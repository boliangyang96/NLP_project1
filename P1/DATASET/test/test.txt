Very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have . Do n't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar . Spacious rooms . Perfect for business and for theatre guests . A little quiet area during weekends .
The room wasvery tiny and was very warm . They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do . The bathroom is small . The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review , and does crackle under your feet . I , personally , did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality . The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in . This is basically an old hotel that has been updated . The comment about the closet is true , it is actually indescriable . You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms . The location is convienent but so are many other hotels . If you do stay , fly into Midway , take the Orange Line , you can not go wrong .
When we were stranded in Chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled , our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the Sheraton Towers . After a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in Chicago , arriving at the Sheraton was a joy . The entire staff was wonderful . The bell staff was great helping us ( finally ) let go of the heavy bags , Jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time . We enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others . We ca n't say enough about the staff . If we are in Chicago in the future we will definitely return here !
Our stay at the James in late last August exceeded our expectations . My husband was in Chicago for a business trip , and I tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life . When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors , and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly . He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions . The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive . Our room was also very clean . I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet . The bed was comfortable , and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in . It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin . My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month . The bathroom was also impressive . The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect , and the heater took no time at all to warm up . Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner , I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try , and like everything else they exceeded my expectations . I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms , however , my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities . I truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel , and if we are ever in the Chicago area again we will definitely be staying here . This hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure .
I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel . The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience . Upon arrival I was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around . Our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens , damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid . It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning . Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel .
This was a great hotel right in the heart of the Chicago Loop . Within walking distance to the downtown attractions . Parking is expensive ( $ 50 p/nt ) so we parked at a free remote location ( recreation drive ) since we were n't planning on driving once we checked in . The staff was friendly and helpful . The rooms are large and clean .
Stayed at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and it was not a good experience . The room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into . When I called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room , it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up , and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be . Will not be staying at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park again .
When I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel , my first thought was , '' wow this is very yellow '' , and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day , no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse . my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in . It was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms . i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms .
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it . The atmosphere was very chic & upscale ; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank . My wife even got to bring along her dog ( aka # 1 man ! ) . I would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area .
Just back from a business trip . The Homewood is in a great location just off the Magnificent Mile , includes a great breakfast , heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $ 129 . Without a doubt the best value in Chicago for a long , long time .
I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago ! When I arrived to check in , my reservation that I had made , ( and confirmed ) , 2 weeks earlier , was not in the computer.I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me . The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone , while the office phone rang off the hook . I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room.I 'll never go back , dont waste your money .
I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending . This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations . Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations . Once I did get into my room , there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room . I went down to the front desk and requested a room change . Given their computer problems , that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and did n't have the `` positive attitude in spite of any difficulty '' I 'd expect from such a high profile establishment . The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling . When I hooked up my laptop , I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service . I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies , but as part of their computer problems , the wi-fi service was down . Fortunately , there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi . Granted , I could n't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room , but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices . I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it 's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management . However , the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management . A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks . They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer 's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated . Once I had a chance to relax in the room , there were a few minor details that stood out . The carpet was starting to get worn in places , the edges on some of the furniture was dinged , and my personal pet peeve ... the inside of the drawers were rough , unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes . I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel . But , all things considered , my stay was tolerable . Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep . The wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks .
We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! What I did n't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable . I ca n't remember when I got a better night 's sleep . The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept . We 'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we 're in town !
Had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the Palmer House . The service was wonderful , staff was very friendly towards dog owners , even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was . Easy access to red line from Midway . Valets were prompt at retrieving car ( they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting ) .
When I first looked at the Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel 's website , the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to Chicago . The problems began when I called to make a reservation . The woman who answered was very rude , to say the least . I had a few questions about the spa services . She rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure . I decided that I should n't let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so I made a reservation and soon I was in Chicago . The front desk service was very pleasant when I arrived , and the room seemed clean , other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets . I got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers . It took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order . Yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away . I was baffled considering I was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to Chicago . Needless to say I will not be staying at this hotel again .
My recent stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago could n't have gone worse . Apart from the price of staying there and the slow response time of hotel staff I was totally let down by the food that could be found there . There are many attractions in the area and indeed leaving the hotel is the best part of the experience .
I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago . The staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout . The hotel was very clean and well maintained . The beds were very comfortable ! The hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day . The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel . I reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago !
Here are some pros and cons : Pros : -Good location -Nice staff -Clean room Cons : -Lack of bathroom amenities ( I get better items at a Holiday Inn ) -Housekeeping was n't so great ... 1 . A bathroom rug was taken out of my room ( no idea why ) and never returned it . The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slippery ... I had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall . 2 . I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar .
I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game . My room rocked ! I had a pretty big flat screen , and a super soft bed . The room was clean and stylish , and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out . My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home . I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax .
I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as # 1 in Chicago . I got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave . The view was beautiful . The room was also impeccable . Nice and bright , very fresh and modern . I find it very hard to fault any Sofitel 's . The service , attentiveness of staff , cleanliness and luxury are always top notch . Location was great , head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe 's and restaurants . Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise . A great place to stay , and much better value than Park Hyatt . I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy , such as for the internet . When you are paying top dollar , a few inclusions would be nice .
I had a large , roomy , clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom , big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise . Customer Service here was absolutely incredible , from the doorman to the front desk , to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it . Sure , you get a little outside noise , but it is a big city , that is not unusual ! I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it .
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip . I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade . All I can say is , `` What upgrade ? '' It 's barely anything above what you get normally . And for the price I paid , I was expecting much better acommodations . Because I arrived around 10:30 the night I checked in ( delayed flight ) I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10 . I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you 're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet . Beyond that , it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room . First it was a room mix-up , then it was a missing key card . That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning . Speaking of the next morning , the complimentary breakfast was a joke . When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast , I 'll stay at the next Super 8 I find . And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed . I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago . This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot .
I will never stay at Conrad Chicago again . The employees were rude from the begining . When I asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like I was an inconveniece . The bar staff was n't much better . The maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay . Do not go there !
My husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary . What a wonderful hotel ! ! We had such a great weekend , largely thanks to The Palmer House . Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel , at our fingertips . And the location is perfect -- right in downtown Chicago . We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites . It was exquisite -- so elegant and beautiful . It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in . The service was impeccable . Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed . We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel . It was delicious ! We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway .
The Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a `` luxury boutique hotel '' and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average . Unfortunately , this was not the case . The room I booked was not clean ; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest . There was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned . In addition , although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room , I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke . I will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants , sites and shops all within walking distance . However , given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room , I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again .
My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay ! The rooms were large and comfortable . The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous . Room service was really good and quick , eating in the room looking at that view , awesome ! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it . Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums . Very friendly staff and knowledgable , you cant go wrong staying here .
I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel . The Omni Chicago 's age shows , and not in a `` great ambiance '' way ! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking . I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor , almost like mildew , that permeated the first room we were given . Seriously , it brought tears to my eyes ! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma , but finally agreed to switch us to another room . The new one did n't smell , but was clearly past its prime . Housekeeping was almost nonexistent . We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels . How can you forget to leave towels for the guests ? I 'm not one to complain , but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here , we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment . We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago .
I travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties . I am always satisfied with my stay at Hilton . locations . However , I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites location . This property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when I arrived . The lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful ! My room was in great condition ! Absolutely no complaints . I just figured that a property like this should be recognized . Great job staff ! ! ! ! I will definitely return in the future !
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel . The size of the rooms , and the views of the city are phenomenal . At night the city lights up , and the sight is majestic . The hotel itself , and the employee 's are wonderful , and well worth the pay to stay in such a place . This Hotel has so much to offer , great dining , a fantastic gym set up for those of us , who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing.My wife and I have just left recently , and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out . Big thumbs up to Those who run that place , and helped us enjoy our stay .
We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time . Small rooms , but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene . Lots of interesting amenities in the room . Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping . Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone . Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere . Watch out : The concierge ( like all concierges at big hotels ) will direct you to mediocre , large restaurants where they get kickbacks . We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago . However , the hotel is often full so book early .
The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is absolutely magnificent . The rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect . The staff is always there no matter what . Not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers . I give it two dumbs up . If you are ever in Chicago the InterContinental Chicago is the place to stay .
Since this was our first visit to the `` windy city , '' we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique . We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go . The `` go '' ended up being a `` no go . '' We were sorely disappointed . When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice . We have two kids with us , so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby . We were told `` no problem . '' Unfortunately , it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next . Then , we noticed a bug ( or bugs ) near the fridge area . Yikes ! We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room ( or floor ! ) . Our request was met about 30 minutes later . By this time , we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions , we almost wanted to throw the towel in . Customer service was so lacking ! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city , but had to wait around for our new room and the crib . This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price ! Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again .
My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May , 2009 . She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city . We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos . $ 249/night stay for $ 99/night plus we got the full buffet breakfast . The room was wonderful . Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area . We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move . The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows . No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit ( poor taps ) . We could have upgraded to river view for $ 20/night but chose not to . We enjoyed the room for what it was . 22nd floor looking south . The buffet breakfast was great . Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs , non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please . Great to have breakfast included in night stay . Might be a bit dear to pay at $ 22/person . It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast , coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal . Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat , always informative and ready to provide maps , directions , multiple suggestions and even make the reservations . Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs . Location was great . Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river . If in Chicago again , would not hesitate to stay here again . A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it .
We got an awesome deal through Priceline for a Friday - Sunday stay at $ 75 for each night . The hotel is very centrally located on Michigan Avenue `` The Magnificent Mile '' . You can walk to a ton of shops & there are plenty of restaurants handy as well . The hotel staff was very friendly , and the room itself was gorgeous . Very modern decor . Not drab & typical like most other chain hotels . If staying in Chicago we definitely will be staying there again . Price for valet parking overnight was insane ( $ 42/day ) , but what do you expect in a big city .
I have recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and the visit was most unpleasant . This hotel was loud and the staff was very rude . All the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs . The hotel food was old , it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there . The beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a `` nice place to spend a vacation ''
My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February . This little hotel was the perfect place for us . The lobby is very small but also cozy , and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold . The staff was very friendly and efficient . The room was pretty spacious , and the king bed was extremely comfortable . We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st , so there was really no view . The bathroom was a good size , including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower . There was also free wireless internet ... a big plus for us . Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location . We were only a few steps from State , Rush , and North Michigan . Tons of shopping , bars , and good food are easily within walking distance . This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in . We highly recommend the Talbott , and will gladly stay again on return trips .
I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel , I really did . It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access . I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon . I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in . I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck , doing nothing . As I walked in , nobody greeted me , and nobody offered to take my bags . The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated , with a fine covering of dust . I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys , all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer . I got to my room , and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking , there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway . Having paid extra for an upgraded room , I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside . The drinking glasses were filthy , the towels smelled of mold , and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can . The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old , and there was no channel guide , though I suppose I did n't need one for the six channels that it had . I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel , but alas , there was no respite here . The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive , and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done . Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better . Everywhere I went , from the pool to the bar , the staff was hasty , rude , and completely uninterested , and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated . I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel , but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out .
The hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night . For THREE consecutive nights . There was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street ( OK - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor ) . I hesitate to write this review but I rely on Trip Advisor reviews when traveling , and had I been warned about the ambulance sirens , I would have chosen to stay elsewhere . If you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value . Conveniently located . Wonderful staff . But quiet is a key priority for me so I would not stay here again . : (
My wife and I 's stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the Windy City . Upon our arrival , we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff . In seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of Lake Michigan . In terms of accommodations , I have never personally stayed at a hotel that I could complement more . On our very first night , my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while I swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool . We followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the Chi bar , which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere . Retiring to our rooms , I could n't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular . I had a very comfortable night 's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff . After a quick bite to eat the LB Bistro , we headed out to sight-see . Overall , I ca n't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers enough . As far as this customer is concerned , it is the only place to stay if you are in the Chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service , atmosphere , and amenities . I could n't recommend it more .
This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat . The first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket . This place looks alright in the lobby , but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago , this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night . Clearly the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession . Not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic . Chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached , particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call .
This hotel does not live up to the reviews . The room was larger than I expected . However , the decor was a bit dated . The bedding was ripped , carpet was stained , and the shower door was broken . There was a long wait to the elevators , and if you 're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym . The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff . There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk . There are no ice machines in this building , so you have to request it from the front desk . One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person . 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice . I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait . I finally got the ice 10 minutes later . Two days later I requested ice again . Waited 30 minutes and just gave up . While I was leaving , I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said `` I did n't get a call for ice . '' Well I obviously was n't making it up , lady ! I called and spoke with someone . She did n't even apologize or offer me anything . Overall , I would not recommend this hotel . There are so many hotels in the Chicago area . Choose a different one .
While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside , my experience went downhill once I walked in . The lighting is very poor , which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere . The mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle . I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay . I definitely would not stay here again .
This place was absolutely foul . From the minute I walked in , I knew making a reservation here was a mistake . The person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like I was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in . The room we requested ( a room with double beds ) was not available . They told me that when I made the reservation , requesting double beds was a `` request '' and not a `` guarantee . '' What 's the point of making a reservation , then ? When we got to the room , the room was totally gross . The decor was dated , the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy . The bathroom had spots and stains all over it . I hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets . The `` complimentary '' fitness area was a joke . One broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells . Thanks but no thanks . We will definitely not return .
This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be . The website and it 's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in . The amenities were not what I was looking for , and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there . My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels . The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area , and they were not very prompt when responding to requests . I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there , but they need to have more staff on hand if they can not provide their hotel guests with quality service . I do n't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon .
We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean , hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing . We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny .
Do NOT stay at this hotel ! A friend and I booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago . Though it was a bit pricy , we decided on the Knickerbocker because it was in a great location , and the rooms looked large and well-kept . Our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time . However , despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay , when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room . The concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us , and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late . To top it off , the maid service was terrible . The only thing they seemed to do was make the bed ; no vacuuming , no fresh towels , etc . We did n't want to stay the third night , but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee . This hotel is way too much money for the services they provide , you 'd be better off staying in a Motel 6 .
My $ 200 Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th . I filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them . This was such a disappointment , as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago . Our room was really nice , with 2 bathrooms . We had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed . We had a great view of the lake and park . The hotel charged us $ 25 to check in early ( 10am ) .
The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation . Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home ! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful . I especially enjoyed the gym . The staff was friendly and helpful . I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home .
The pictures on this website sure are deceiving ! In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be ! The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning ! Now , granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip . It was n't ! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we do n't even drink , no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway ! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time , so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip . We had to spend $ 50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we 'd planned ! And then it was n't as good because the tour guide was n't there and we got lost ! My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one . It was terrible ! I certainly wo n't be staying here again !
Do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business ? Then the James Hotel in Chicago is the place for you . Superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight . Followed by spacious rooms , luxurious linens , and all-natural Kiehl 's body shampoos and lotions . I absolutely loved my stay at the James Hotel in downtown Chicago . The bathrooms have raised sinks , and all of the luxurious amenities you would want . I absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch . I felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere . I definitely would stay again , and plan to stay at the James in New York as well
My wife and I travelled to Chicago and really were treated like royalty by the hotel staff ! ( My brother and his wife also stayed during this period . ) The front desk staff , the concierge , the Star Bucks server , the restaurant , the lounge servers . . . all were wonderful ! The rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great ! The bath room was a real plus ... it was huge and had everything one desires . Great view from 20th floor to Michigan Avenue below ! Overall , great stay and highly recommended !
I went to stay in the Millenium Hotel Chicago . Now , first , being from rural midwest I was surprised at the price in general , but kind of accepted it when I was assured by my cousin ( whom I was visiting in Chicago ) said it was normal . So I check in , service seems fine . I get checked in , room seems ok. A couple of hours later , a lady comes into my room , not a hotel employee , just some lady . Turns out , they cross checked the rooms . We ( her and I ) went down and complained . Turns out they double booked the room , not that they were full , but they were full on THAT room type , Standard , as well as the Superior Rooms . Rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to `` move up '' . We argued with them for 20 minutes , they did n't budge , our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $ 60 for a Corner Superior . We ( the lady , her name was Sharon ) decided to split the difference some , she gave me $ 20 and I moved . I get to the new room about 20 minutes later , nobody , but Sharon helped me move . I get there , the bed was thrown together , not made , and the bathroom was n't clean , the garbage had a kleenex in it ( I was n't going to check if it was used ) . I called down , it was now 5PM . No answer , I called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone . I told them about the state of my room . They said they would have someone up `` right away '' . I waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in , not in uniform , but she did a hell of a job cleaning . She switched out the garbage , wiped out the whole bathroom , vaccuumed around me , and switched out the bedding , all told she was in and out in 10 minutes . She did n't say two words to me , but she did clean . I stayed the night and checked out a 7AM and will never go back . Ryan from Iowa
The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere . It was clean , comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check-in , use the concierge , check-out , or report a problem to the front desk , forget about it . I booked this place through Priceline.COM so I ca n't complain too much as I did n't pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel . It left a lot to be desired . The minibar fridge in my room did n't work so forget about a cold beer . Also , the internet/movie/guest services console did n't work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet . When it was time to checkout the console still was n't working . It 's better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel
My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back . The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either . When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key . When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made . The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food . We ended up going home two days before we planned .
From the moment I walked in I was impressed . The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming . The hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent . My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen . I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay . I will definitely book another stay at this hotel .
When I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago , I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver . Everything was just ok . I do not spend money on a quality hotel for `` just ok '' . If I want `` just ok '' I 'll check into the Days Inn ! First of all there were problems with our reservation . I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor ! The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this . I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process . Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us . The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure . On the second day of our stay , housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee . They also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets . Minor I know , but when you 're paying for a luxury experience , you kind of expect luxury ! The hotel itself was nice but the staff really do n't deliver . I would not stay here again . You can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 1/4 the price and the staff is much more helpful .
I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago . It is a very nice hotel , and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again ! There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel ; staff is excellent , never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for . Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast . A few things that could make this hotel even better ... A hand shower in the bathroom . The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom , instead of the bathroom , when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair . Free internet access in the lobby . I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD ( for 15 minutes ) to log-on and check-in with my airline ( only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying ? ! ? ! ? ! ? )
The Hilton Chicago is one of the best Hotels I have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life . It is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the `` Cultural Michigan Avenue Mile '' , and it overlooks Grant Park , Lake Michigan , and Museum Campus . In addition to overlooking those wonderful sights , it 's also located conveniently close to Chicago 's convention center , McCormick Place Convention Center , as well as the business center , shopping and theatre . Furthermore , there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel , such as Millenium Park , Buckingham Park , and the Sears Tower . The amenities offered by the Hilton Chicago hotel include 100 % wireless Internet access in all guest rooms , 27 '' inch flat screen televisions , a Serenity Bed , and two-line direct dial phones . And on top of all that , the hotel is pet friendly ! I 'll definitely be staying here again .
Hi , Stayed here for three nights recently , From check in to check out all Staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us , directions , restaurants , transport , nothing was too much trouble , The dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise , also the breakfast was more than adequet , Stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly , Hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller.Restaurants and shopping all within 5-10 mins .
After reading good reviews about the Affinia Hotel in Chicago , my husband and I decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary . Unfortunately , the hotel missed the mark for us . I did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel . Because my husband and I have had a bad experience with bedbugs , as a rule , we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel . When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff , they practically accused us of planting the bugs there . I was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled . Needless to say , we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary . I have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation . I have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that I will be refuting the charge for the one night the Affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline .
Very luxurious and worth the money . If you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose . The staff was great and friendly . Dont forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat .
I think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place.I had my wedding there and it was the best of the best.The staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success . The chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts.They also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake.The tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect.The bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain . My guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered.The rooms were like suites with a mini bar.They had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom . If you are looking to have a wedding in the Chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed !
We spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience . As described in previous reviews . the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding . Service was excellent overall ( I especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service ) . The door and bellmen/women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable . We had completely satisfactory ( though overpriced ) drinks in the bar but did n't eat at the restaurant . The health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained . While there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers , I never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a Chicago winter ! One minor quibble -- I like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker . The restaurant offered free coffee `` to-go '' but only before eight AM . This is a very , very comfortable , attractive hotel in a wonderful location . Chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money .
The James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations . A haven of cool , uncluttered comfort in a hot , crowded but congenial city . Located within steps of some of the greatest art , architecture , culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America , the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited . The check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm , restorative oasis . It is difficult to over-praise the friendly , attentive staff ; this is a hotel that truly has its act together ! The day before our visit ended , we experienced problems with the room 's air conditioner . When the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem , we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline . We eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities .
My husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night . I called the hotel and spoke with Eric , he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation , he said no and that was the end of it . My husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookit.com as well . I called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement . I informed courtney from bookit.com that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by Eric . She spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name . I got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he `` didnt recall '' saying that . I was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! He said , no ma'am i dont remember saying that . I said so since you dont remember thats it ? ? ? I said my husband heard him say it b/c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there . I asked to speak to Erica , told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on . I asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth . I have never writte . A review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this . Erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome . VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN ! !
I had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin . It was a sudden trip and I did n't even have the time to book a hotel before hand . When I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel , he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel . I was impressed with how clean it was and they did n't have a problem with getting me a room even though I did n't have a reservation . The staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel , which was just a short two nights , and the cleaning service was top notch .
Not impressed at ALL . The hotel itself looks really nice , especially in the big foyer area . Our room was small , and the bathroom needed some major upgrades . It had the green tile , like at your grandmother 's house , all over the walls , and 2 people could n't fit in it if you tried . We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning , so obvioulsy the walls are n't so thick . Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside , VERY close , we could n't even tell if it was nice outside or not . We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it , and I felt yucky the whole time in it . I just would n't pay lots of money to stay here , there is nothing exceptional about it at all .
Often visit Chicago , but this was my first stay at this location . Was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo . Thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated . Was very disappointed in the service . Stayed on a Saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late . Also received an incorrect folio under my door ( another guests that was staying at this location ) . I called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected . I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later . I called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department . Received a message to call the billing department , have called three times - but have not received another reply back .
I stayed at the Hyatt for a two nights on a business trip . My room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and NBC Building . Both the room and the bathroom were spotless and the room had an air purifier which ran silently . The hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area . I would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend .
The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing little get away right on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago . This hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities ! The beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms ( at least both times I have stayed ) . The Windy City Spa provides a relaxing getaway as well.The indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent . The garage was very secure and has unlimited in/out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty . All in all , well worth it and will plan to stay again !
I booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline and was able to get a rate of $ 45/night ! Ca n't go wrong with that ! The rooms are nice , spacious , clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need . I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service . I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly , which you do n't often see at other hotels . I used the self-check in machine , and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly . Then , when she saw that my room was not on a high level , she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view . I would highly recommend this hotel !
I stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town . It was a little pricey , but definitely worth it ! The staff was super friendly , the pool was clean and well-maintained , and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs ( I 'm a vegetarian ) . Plus , I paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous . I would definitely recommend .
This is a great hotel ! From the doorman who greeted us as we arrived , to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine , everyone was very friendly and helpful . We were `` strangers but for a minute ! '' The room was extremely clean , well appointed and we had a pretty view of the Chicago River , especially enjoyed from the large window seats . Loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll ! Hallways were large and quiet . The restaurant next door , South Water Kitchen is very nice too . The location is in walking distance of the theatres , parks , the river ( take a cruise ) , Michigan Ave . It 's ideal . The only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful . For a self-sufficient traveler , you would n't really need their services ( although it is nice ) but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time , a concierge can be very helpful . I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it .
We stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July ( July 1-3 ) . The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo . We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food & beverages . I also signed up for their loyalty program , which was so worth it . I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid . But I was totally wrong ! They treated us extremely well . Before our arrival , I got an email asking if we needed anything . So , I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk . And they arranged it for us without charge : ) We arrived late on Thursday night . Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested . We were given a corner suite on the 10th floor ... very nice room ... comfy bed . My husband was really wowwwww ! ! ! The bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed ( we did n't use the sofa-bed though ) . We got a high-speed Internet as part of the loyalty program . All staff were friendly and helpful ... front desk , valet parking , bell boy , room service , concierge , ... everyone ! We used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning . The first day was great . Food was great , and quick . We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program . We ordered OJ and hot chocolate . They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning . But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible . It tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate : ( Also , we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast , which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries ... but we got a plain waffle . So , we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those . This is why I did n't give `` 5 '' for service . However , I reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out , and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal . Another thing is that it 's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor . We could hear siren going on & off during the night . But this is out of the hotel 's control though . And I would say that it did n't bother us at all . My baby could sleep very well . Overall , we really enjoyed our stay , and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago .
Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see . The room we had at almost $ 400 a night was dingy and small . Do n't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there , it is n't . They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items . The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods . When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it was n't a choice . The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again , we called the Manager who did get it to us . The staff did appear friendly , although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb ' sign and would call us on the phone . Do n't make the mistake of staying here but if you do , walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $ 3 plus 19 % gratuity . We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us . This is the most overpriced , over rated and dingy hotel we 've ever stayed in . Taxi to airport is $ 40 .
This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life . Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice . Whether if it 's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite , all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based , so it suits ones personality . Even if you are a super sized person , like me with a height of 6 '' 4 ' , there are special `` Tall Rooms '' just for you . My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there . In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel . Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper . Before I go to a meeting , I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service . After I come back from the meeting , I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines . I just did n't want to leave that hotel ; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago , I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago .
I disliked the Sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the Grand Hyatt after the first night . We checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately . We were tired from our flight , but went downstairs to change rooms . The second suite smelled just as bad , but stayed anyway . I disliked the hotel lobby , the staff , the decorating , and especially the bed . HORRIBLE . Soft , flimsy mattress . We come to Chicago frequently . We have always stayed at the Grand Hyatt and never been disappointed . We just thought we 'd try some place new . Never again . Back to the Hyatt or Four Season we go !
Great location in Chicago downtown . The staff is professional and warm . The room is spacious and clean . Nice complimentartry breakfast . I will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago .
I would never stay here again . For a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel , it can not even provide the most basic amenities and services . I would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel . The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained .
The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible . The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they did n't even have a record of our reservation . After much inappropriate arguing , they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine . When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV . It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably . The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in . A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount . We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel , the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club . Overall , the service at the Sofitel was rude , rooms were unsatisfactory , restaurant sub-par , not well kept up or clean . In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record , like the FancyPants Hotel and suits , my personal favorite .
Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services . First of all , from reading other reviews , now I know I got ripped @ $ 249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $ 79 ( albiet , I got free wifi ) . The hotel is nice ; but it can only get so nice for an oldie ... no matter how much money you dump into it . Shower head was really low ( I 'm 6 ' 1 '' ) , water pressure was low . It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by ( check out reviews on Yelp ! ) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds ( they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone ) . If traveling here : 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Do n't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class ( although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor ) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple ... it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers ( sp ? ) trying to save money .
This lovely hotel has only six floors , making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception . The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it . Trump 's huge new tower is just down the street . The Amalfi looks recently refurbished , very modern , but warm and inviting . Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very , very comfortable beds . Bathroom quite small but roomy enough , with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers . Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor . Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc ( robes & slippers provided ) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast . Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception , especially the Amalfitinis . A nice way to relax after a hard days ' shopping ! Location is great for all the shops , transport , museums etc . Easy walking to everywhere . Staff also very friendly and welcoming . Would definately stay there again .
I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007 . I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night . However , this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor . EXCELLENT view of the city , river and Lake Michigan . In fact , I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity . The room was huge , and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice . The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park . Would very much recommend this hotel , and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor .
Three nights there on business . Had n't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement , very bleak . Told the front desk that I had n't realized about the construction , so I 'd have to switch hotels , they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights . So I stayed . TV did n't work . Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me ... eventually after I called again , a few hours later , a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it . Long and complicated experience at the business center ( which does n't open until 9am , BTW ) , where I ended up paying $ 45 to print 55 pages . Had to buy these cards , and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway , ( and charging me for them ) . I was left with $ 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago , 2000 miles from where I live . I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that . Nice room , nice view , but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad . Worst experience I 've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business .
My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said , `` I wish we could stay longer '' . That good ! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door . Everything is high tech . Plasma TV , CD/Radio , Projection alarm clock ( love that so much bought one today ) . If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful . They even have a four legged friend menu . The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided . The bed was the best in a hotel ever . Linens were crip , white and fresh . Maid service twice daily with turn down service . Safe in room , ice delivered , iron , hairdryer all top of the line . The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor . Mid-century style with funky chair/ottman , cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home . The staff was courteous and accommodating . The library , free internet access , in room wifi were extras we did n't expect . Bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby . Funky artwork . Location , location , location . The best place we 've ever stayed not only in Chicago . Highly recommend .
I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation . When I first made the reservation I did not get an e-mail confirmation . I had to call again to get the e-mail and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me , my wife and three year old . I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at , however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room . I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me . i told them to cancel the room . based on the reservation experience , I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel .
Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY , I had very high expectations . When I saw the Trip Advisor rating , I immediately booked . What a huge disappointment : -- The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap , foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for $ 4 . You can not sleep on these -- The windows are so thin , you can hear the buzzing from walk/do n't walk sign on Superior below . -- The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked , I was awaken around midnight , my room engulfed in smoke odor . A call downstairs yielded no results -- There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood ; the desk chair was full of loose threads -- The water flow is very weak , but the towels are nice -- There are unpainted floorboards , the kind you find in Day 's Inn -- They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like . The sign outside is also a banner . Having stayed all over the U.S. , you are better off at Red Roof -- this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain . Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008 . I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand . Good heart , but the problems are not fixable .
My stay was quick but awesome . After a long day , seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner , but then i saw the self-serve kiosks . i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes . in the morning i was able to check out on the TV in my room . the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins . The bed was FABULOUSLY comfortable . i wish i could live there . they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms . i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we did n't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms . talk about squeals of delight . that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach . i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms , but it 's the first time i 've seen this since . what a great feature !
We got a great deal on this hotel , just $ 91 found through travelzoo . We only stayed one night , but were very impressed . The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property . The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate . Our room , while not enormous was perfect . We had a great view of the city and lake . The bed was extremely comfortable . We never heard any noise outside of our room . The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel , two could get ready very comfortably . Location was perfect , just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park . We would definetly stay here again , especially if we could get this great deal !
Location is excellent , but do n't valet your car there , ( 53.00 a day ) . Bed was to soft , pillows were flat , we could n't open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way . All in all not what you 'd expect from a hotel in that area .
Do n't stay here ! My family and I stayed here for a weekend trip . The staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them . The rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it had n't been dusted in ages . Overall bad service and not worth the money .
This is a great find for downtown Chicago . The price is right and the staff are excellent . As noted , there is construction going on around the hotel , but I did n't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping . I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor , and was gladly given one . The lobby is small , the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel . The concierge , Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations ( along with a complimentary appetizer ) . We had a standard room , and it was spacious , tastefully decorated -- everything we needed . The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking -- and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk . Just ca n't say enough about how nice the staff are -- every single person you meet . Would definitely stay here again .
Excellent location , feels like a boutique hotel . Right next to Neiman Marcus ( V.expensive dept store ) and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower . As most American , medium to high end , hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception . Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment . The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer . They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling
We stayed for just one night , but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite . The rooms were clean and large . The decor had just been redone . The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night . We got a great rate and would go back . Great location for walking around .
While the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful , the hotel is actually far from it . Even booking a room online was rather difficult , and i was n't able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers . In general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks , its a mistake i wont make again and you should n't either .
The Millennium Hotel Knickerbocker sounds fine , and the website is pretty , but the reality is an over-hyped , overpriced , reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package . The catering they offer is a joke ; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the Chicago area . While the rooms were cleaner than most , there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses , and when I called to complain about it , a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off . The rooms look small but cozy when you book online , but when you get there in person , you realize just how tiny they are . Trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did I mention that it smelled like cleaning solution ? I also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed , which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is . In fact , it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small ; you 'd get better prices and a far better room from the Hilton .
For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel , I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location . The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed , and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot . The food is good , location is great , everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here .
The Ambassador East Hotel , located in downtown Chicago , is one of the BEST hotels I 've ever stayed in . My wife and I went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the Ambassador East on a hotel booking website . Their rates are very , very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide . I was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and could n't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend . I was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer , which is nice because most places in Chicago are very impersonal . All in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area . 5/5 Stars .
I stayed at the James in June , and I must say , it felt like I was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel . From the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such , to the wonderful , comfortable beds , the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed . The gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym , and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition . I really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl 's products as well as the soft , cushy beds with futons . Location-wise , it 's just off Michigan ave , and it 's close to all the shops and restaurants . I 'd definitely stay here if I 'm ' ever back in Chicago .
great bed , but when I first came in , I requested a room with a lake view ( i requested this over the phone as well ) , and the front desk woman said `` this is a great room '' . I go upstairs and its awful looking . The view was of the neighboring roofs . Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room . Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view . Horrible experience . also rooms were small and had crappy look ( yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets )
Excellent service ! Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago . Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile . Great concierge service . Pricey though ... Do n't valet if you do n't need to .
The Omni was chosen for it 's location whichworked out perfectly . The bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean ... until ... I sat down in the tub ... there was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder , in the cracks on the walls between the tile , all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl . Needless to say I drained the tub and took a shower ... I really do n't care for showers . Oh yes ... the toilet leaked as well ... The staff were very helpful but I was disappointed . I travel extensively and do n't think I will return . we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken , so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel , printed the presentation and delivered it to our room . They try ! We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building ... but we were n't there too much .
It has been a couple of years since I stayed here , and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire . I paid only $ 100 and stayed a Saturday night . I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel . The lobby has always been great , but the rooms were a little shabby in the past . Not any more , as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years . The location is still amazing , and with the Berghoff open again , there is a great restaurant within walking distance .
We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House Hilton . We were in Chicago for a weekend stay , and wanted something close to State Street , and convenient to the theatre district and the museums , and Michigan Ave. shopping . This is a grand old hotel , with just about every amenity one could wish for . The lobby is fabulous , and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . Our room had a nice king sized bed , and was pretty cozy . Hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us . I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a `` grand hotel '' type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown Chicago . You will definitely feel special .
We stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again . It was great place front desk clerks were very helpful.Also we loved the view . Very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean . We will def stay here again highly recommended .
The location is ideal . They have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are . The views are great . There were fresh flowers in the bathroom . They had all white bedding . You feel like a princess there .
This was one of the best hotels I 've stayed at in Chicago . I 've also tried Amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown . This one was the best . Great service , beautiful room , roomy bathroom , top-notch amenities .
-Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel , located in Chicago , has extrodinary scenary . The hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking . Hungry ? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables . The hotel also host events such as ballet , fun in the bar and a dj to name a few . This hotel is definitely worth your while . I will most definitely visit again . Book your reservation as soon as possible and do n't forget your camera !
I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago , and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around . I chose to stay at the Talbot , an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago . To start off , I was NOT pleased . For the hundreds I pay a day , I expected an impeccable hotel . First , the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance . Some customer service they claim . Next , when I went to my room , I found that room service had not cleaned it at all . I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such . In summary : yes , it was a fancy hotel , yes it had nice accommodations , but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price .
I am writing about my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel . I just wanted to let you know what a wonderful team you have working there . Everyone from check-in to check-out could n't have been more helpful or personable . It made my mundane business trip a very pleasureable one . The hotel is spotless , very comfortable and the restaurant is one of Chicago 's finest . You really offer the finest quality in both product and service . The only complaint I have is that internet access is not free . I would just like to mention one person in particular- Sofie . She worked on the front desk and she went above and beyond to make my stay as smooth as possible . She even helped me out with taxi services and local recommendations . I shall look forward to returning next month . Thank you . Yours , P. Grady
We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night . We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay . The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom . The tub is large and the shower a pleasure . The location was quiet as requested . The staff was always cheerful and very helpful . Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services ! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day . We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel . I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay .
I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro . The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window . After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet . This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began . After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested . We were informed that they were `` only requests '' and not a guarantee . Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed . When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted . The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order was n't exactly right either . This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel .
This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue , a five minute walk from the Orange `` Loop '' line that will get you to and from Midway Airport . Forget about taking a taxi : the train is a $ 2 ride and less than 40 minutes away . Our room ( 1802 ) was immaculate and spacious ( 350 sq ft , we were told ) . Decorated in grays and white , the room was comfortable and soothing , not jarring . On the other hand , we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading , finding keys , etc . No kidding . The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp . On the positive side , however , there were Aveda products in the bathroom , the windows were huge , so during the day there was tons of natural light , and no issues with darkness . The king size bed was very firm , but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting . We had a largish TV with a DVD player . There is a safe and munchies . The gym is perfect , equipped with treadmills , ellipticals , bikes and weights . It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety . There are towels , water , headphones , disposable ear pads , and complimentary green apples . Suggestion : if you are on a floor below the 22nd , take the elevator up to 22nd , then down to L2 to get to the gym . This way you dont have to traverse the lobby . The front desk staff is amiable , and very attentive . I read some other reviews about nasty personnel , but did not have that experience at all . I got a free newspaper with a smile , a free stamp when I needed it , change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning . The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower , the Drury Theater , John Hancock , and magnificent mile . For those who like a thrifty breakfast , we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [ -- ] . This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning , no less : $ 1.99 . The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $ 15.00 per person , but we did not partake of it . We would stay at the Hard Rock again , and think it is great for people with `` tweens . '' Not sure about the toddler set , though .
I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago . We chose the hotel for it 's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location . In retrospect , the phrase `` location , location , location '' apparently does not apply to hotels . It 's a good thing the location was so great , because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad . Upon our arrival , our room was not ready . The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation , and told us simply that `` we would have to wait '' without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready . When we finally arrived in the room , the sheets were not clean . A call to housekeeping proved difficult , as I do not speak Spanish . The second day of our trip , housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our `` please service '' sign hung on the door . We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave . When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order , it was cold and not very good . Despite these poor impressions , the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout . My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai . They will not receive my business again .
I had really high hopes for this hotel . The location seemed great and the prices were too . Unfortunatley , you get what you pay for . Despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier , there were n't many other redeeming qualities . The staff was very rude . We arrived late after a long drive from Detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in . Once we finally got checked in , our room had n't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people . We were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they could n't get to it until morning ! We had planned on seeing some of Chicago 's attractions like the Field Museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go . Their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them . Finally , when we checked out , they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night . RIDICULOUS !
We stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday . Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal . 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo , voss and evian water , and gorgeous bathroom ( no tub but was fine for us ) Concierge was very helpful . You can not beat this location ... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow ( 2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning ) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant . Food was very good so it was worth the wait . I would return in a heartbeat . A gem in chicago ...
No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner . I would n't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel , let alone an Omni . Great location and the bar is nice .
Terrible experience , I will not stay here again . The walls were so thin that I was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine . I talked to the management several times , but nothing was done . It may just be the people that I had contact with , but I thought the staff was standoffish and rude . Very unpleasant experience , especially given the cost of staying here !
I had heard good things about the Ambassador East and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake ! First off , they charge for being able to use the internet , which should be a given these days , especially for how much you pay for the room . The `` champagne '' was cheap , I could have spent $ 15 to get my own bottle . The King room was just as small as a double room anyway . The bed was really hard , and crudely made . Maybe there was someone new on the staff that did n't know how to make a bed , but besides that , the sheets were starched to military stiffness . It was so uncomfortable ! When I asked if we might get some new sheets , the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because they 're `` all that way '' . I was appalled ! Anyway , we gave it a shot and stayed there that night , in the mediocre luster of the room design . We did n't sleep well and did n't particularly enjoy ourselves , especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party ! I mean , talk about the opposite of peaceful ! Again , we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party , but they said they could n't move us because of the romance package . What a jip ! After the kind of `` fun '' we 'd had , we realized we could n't handle anymore . We called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours . We wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay , and he said he 'd do that , but that we 'd still be charged a percentage of it ! After telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were , we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing .
A bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance . Will definitely stay here again
I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009 . The room , the bathroom , the view , and the staff were all wonderful . I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North ( on MI Ave ) . Sometimes , when you 're tired , that extra couple of blocks seem like miles !
This place had character I 'll give it that . But it was n't really my style . Arrived late in the evening . The first room they gave me the TV did n't work . Maintenance took a look at it , and could n't figure it out . Told me I 'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician . He then passed some gas and left . Real professional . I phoned the front desk on account of the tv , and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first . Horrible striped wall paper , dingy , and old worn carpet . Bathroom was incredibly small . Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door , or the sink . Very cramped . The beds were n't very comfortable either . Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy . Location seem very convenient . I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away . But all of the theatres seemed to be near by , if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two . And do n't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card . It was about $ 2/minute . I knew it would be expensive but was n't expecting that type of rate .
This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price ! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses . We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers . They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner . The fitness center was very clean , I did n't want to leave it ! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included ! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery . Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated . But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff . We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago !
I am writing in regards to our stay April 22-24 . We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay . There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay . My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival ... it was n't . When he called to place the order again , it never showed up . We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time . Our room was very small , drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for . We had called to request a room with a large tub , similar to the ones in the photos , prior to our arrival , noting that we did n't mind an upgrade cost . Instead , the tub was incredibly small . We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location , especially considering we were celebrating such a happy , once-in-a-lifetime occasion . The service and amenities just did n't match up .
The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago . It is just a few blocks from the train station , so it was easy to get anywhere in town . The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful . We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities . The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful .
The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly , yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly . The staff seemed miffed and stuck up , and I had to wait for the personal check in . I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited , and other guests ( all single or couples without children ) seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in . This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two , even though it is advertised as such . I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising , Amalfi .
WOW ! ! Where do I start ? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown . Check in was a breeze , the entire staff was friendly and helpful . Our room was huge . The king bed was very comfortable . Our room also had 2 nightstands , 2 chairs with a small table , a desk , and walk-in closet . Even with all the furniture , the room was very spacious . The room did show some signs of wear , but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel . The hotel is located in a neighborhood , so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel . There is very little noise , however , you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets , with all the nightlife , and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away . We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew , we were at the Hancock building . By staying here , you are away from the noise , but not away from the action . Had breakfast at the Pump Room , which is a story in itself . We had our photo taken in booth 1 . Take some time and research who has sat in this booth . It is impressive . Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room . Did n't have a chance to have dinner here , but I will return for dinner someday . Breakfast was not anything fancy , and a bit pricy , but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion . The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was . I ca n't wait to return here !
The Inter Continental is a great hotel . The staff was very friendly , and the accomidations were great . The room was clean and ready on time , and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering Chicago 's weather . Eno was simply AMAZING . Their wine selection is second to none . And the Turkey Pumpkin Curry at Zest was to die for .
This is a great hotel , in a great location , in a great city ! ! ! There 's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part . The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker ( s ) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they 're not my cup of tea , I was happy enough with George staring back @ me ! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the `` Cheesecake Factory '' or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the `` John Hancock Centre '' . A slighty longer walk ( or a short cab ride ) and you 're at the `` Navy Pier '' - take a ride on the `` Seadog '' then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music . This hotel ( & city ) is WELL worth checking out .
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . My husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary . We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren . My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married . Everyone was so excited ! Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites . We had n't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered . Unfortunately , when we got to our room , the view was disappointing . We had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one , but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there . I am asthmatic and became very ill. We asked to be moved to another room , but were told there were no other rooms ( even downgrades ) available . Nothing was done to try to make up for this . Because of my health , my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend . This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time . Now , when I think of my 10th anniversary , I will always have this memory to tarnish it .
I have stayed at the Amalfi Hotel before and it has always been excellent . This time was no different . Usually I book direct with the hotel , however , I found a slightly better deal booking through Expedia , which saved about $ 100 . The staff were great . I arrived early and they had a room waiting . I was placed on the 6th ( top ) floor and it was quiet and comfortable . Overall , it was as good as it gets ! I will definitely continue to stay here when I 'm in Chicago . Remember , the hotel is close to everything - downtown , the Magnificent Mile , lots of restaurants , etc . Everything is within walking distance !
IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA . This is basically a Holiday Inn . Half of the rooms overlook an alley / loading dock . The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am . At 530 , when you are just nodding off again , they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast . This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank . Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise . Reception was a bit tacky and the `` staff '' was a little rough around the edges . I did n't see a single business travellers while I was there . Valet parking was expensive ( usual for Chicago ) but was very slow . Just ok . Explore other options .
Recently stayed at the James Chicago and will NOT be returning anytime soon . The staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous . Also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests . There was n't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely . Ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment .
This is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler . It offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined . With a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace , they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague . The restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client . And all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown Chicago
We loved this hotel and would definitely come back . Initially we were n't given a goldfish , which was disappointing , but then we left a tip for the housekeeper , and she rewarded us with one . We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon . The staff were quite friendly and helpful , even printing our boarding passes for us . Our room was very comfortable , with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper . At first we were worried about noise , since our room was next to the elevator , but we hardly heard it , and did n't notice any street noise either . The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated , well-lit , and ideally located .
Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay . This hotel 's five-star rating needs a downgrade ! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago , The Fairmont was among the classiest brands . No more . My 29th floor room was expansive , but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working . The upholstery was frayed , the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water , and the room 's door did n't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way . Worse , the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you , with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser . It was like sleeping in an old vending machine , but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message , there was none to be found . Other reviewers remarked that this hotel `` needs updating , '' but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame . For instance , someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations . I could n't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space would n't accommodate my legs . ( I am not unusually tall . ) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars , that the Fairmont should n't be able to compete . See my profile for better ideas . Niftyc
We loved the hotel . When I see other posts about it being shabby I ca n't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about . Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms , lobby was fabulous , pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym , staff was courteous . For us , the location was great -- across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres . I 'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location . Got it for $ 105 on Hotwire . What a bargain for such a nice hotel .
I had a great time here ! It is centerally located in Chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent . The staff was amazing and very helpful ! Parking was a bit steep , but to be expected . The room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable . The yoga mat rental was wonderful as well ! Wonderful and relaxing experience overall .
Guys trip to Chicago , scored this hotel on Priceline for $ 100 a night . Had a little confusion over the bed situation at first . They said they only had kings available even after I had called and requested 2 doubles . After a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles . The room was nice , nothing specacular , a little on the small side but nice . The lobby was beautiful to look at but that 's about it . Hotel is within walking distance to Soldier Field , Sears Tower , ESPN Zone , and lots of bars and restaurants . Great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip . Would definately try and stay at this hotel again .
We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city . Although the hotel looks nice , the service is terrible . The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all . The room service closes at 8pm so do n't plan on getting hungry after that time . Also , even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries . I will never go back to that place
We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes . I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbocker-as I had stayed when I was younger . We reserved a King Non-Smoker . Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room . When argued they stated `` well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority '' . As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on . We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light . Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels . Also , I must add the room reaked of smoke . The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems , he told us the total and had not concern of our issues . We also checked in our bags for the day , and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day . We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out . STAY AWAY-even if you get a good deal ! !
The James Chicago is a stuffy , uninviting hotel . If you are looking for all of the comforts of home , do not stay here . The rooms are like boardrooms , not bedrooms . Definitely not a child-friendly hotel . The restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious . I would not vacation here again , especially not with children . They were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel !
We stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary . We got a corner room with both a lake and city view . The room was very clean and spacious . The staff was extremely friendly and helpful . We asked for late checkout , and was told no problem . If you bring your car , park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away . The cost there is $ 14.00 compared to the swissotel which is $ 41.00 .
I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference . My fiance ' accompanied me . When we checked in , we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed . So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined , we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house ! We discovered that the coffee maker was n't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it , and waited two and half hours . We had issues with the plumbing , including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill . The toilet stopped working twice . We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room , sitting on the bed , watching the tv and talking on her cell phone . They bellman were rude , and would n't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment . There were errors on our bill . Last but not least , we saw a ROACH in the drawers . Alive . The restaurant downstairs was decent , and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better . I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances .
The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home . From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby , you will never want to leave . The multiple ballrooms , board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events . If you 're looking for leisure activities , there are two bars , the Lockwood Wine Cellar , and an indoor pool . The staff is professional , friendly and helpful . Room service is excellent , and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city .
I checked in at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago shortly after dinner on Tuesday , I was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk . You can tell people were happy at the hotel . I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room . The room was very well decorated and well thought out . The furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space . Plus it was convenient with lots of power outlets The bedroom and washroom was very clean and I had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed . I was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows , although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea . Once in a while you come across hotels with great service , well thought out rooms in a perfect location ( right off Magnificent Mile ) . When visiting Chicago again I will definitely try and stay at Affinia again
Just returned from the James Hotel after staying at the Park Hyatt . I have stayed at most Chicago Hotels : Pennisula , Four Seasons , The Ritz , Fairmont etc . Had heard a little about the James and the Primehouse at the James . We paid MORE for the room at the James then at any of the above mentioned hotels . What a disappoitment ! The room we stayed in had 2 double beds . The toilet broke and overflowed , the tub didnt drain while showering and the HUGE bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times . The closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all . The room was very small and non descript . Much like staying at an IKEA but without the color . Windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small . The staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly . The room had a huge 52 '' plasma TV that was nice . There is NO way this hotel is 4 star yet . The room rate close to $ 500.00 a night was WAY of of line . We paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels . The rate should have been about half of that .
The staff at the James Chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one . When I entered the establishment to check in , I was ignored . The clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me . Thinking room service would be better , I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food . By the time it reached my room , it was cold AND the wrong order . Disgusted , I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance . All the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star , and none of my regular channels were on the tv . All in all , it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago .
I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery . They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived . The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group . We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon . We went to speak with the front desk . We were met with `` We ca n't do anything about that right now due to the hour . We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in . '' Unacceptable ! ! ! My $ 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room ! Not my mistake ! FINALLY , after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes , they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered . She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon . All of my belongings were recovered in the security room ; however , all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation ! Terrible , terrible customer service . They sent up an apology letter , champagne , and chocolate covered strawberries to the room . Although I was appreciative of the gesture , it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say `` We ca n't do anything about it . ''
I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held . On the plus side , the hotel is reasonably well located , within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue . My room had a superb view out over the river . However , for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment . The decor was dated , and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty . The wifi is ridiculously expensive , and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access . There was no wifi in the conference rooms , although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails . I know Chicago is expensive , but for that price I feel the experience should have been better .
The room was big and luxurious , befitting the price tag ( $ 299 ) . Bed was very comfortable . However , my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft , and I heard the elevators running all night . Also held a one-day conference there for 25 people . They stuck us in a long , narrow room that was cramped . Also , the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel . Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served . And the steaks were only so-so , a far cry from my experience with other Palms .
I recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased . The decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one , I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go . The staff was so attentive and friendly , and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel . I highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago , brides will not be dissapointed !
Well located and well staffed . The Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay . It lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by . Free continental breakfast and evening cocktail .
I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago . After walking around the city all day , I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place . The service was friendly and I especially liked the location . What a Treat !
Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful . My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite -- absolutely exquisite ! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room . ( Except to go to the gym : ) I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room ! I was surprised by that . This hotel was the definition of 'luxury ' , they had anything we needed and more . My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice ' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door . As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor . I have to admit , cheesy as it may sound , I felt like a queen all weekend long : ) Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at , but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago .
The Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel offered PDA or kiosk check-in which was great . They also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay . We enjoyed the 24/7 stay fit gym , iHome stereo with iPod docking station , flat screen tv with video on demand and Wi-Fi . Concierge staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area . We enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips .
While traveling in Chicago I stayed at the Sofitel on Chestnut Street . Though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest ; service was severely lacking . I arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn . I reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area . I complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room . My complaint was totally disregarded . I was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available . When I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely . The woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop . I understand that the staff has no control over the noise . They did however know about the construction . Information I did not have at the time I booked . Information that would have swayed my decision . Then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention . I will not be staying there again .
I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel ( Chicago Water Tower ) , and I was quite disappointed . I was excited by the great location ( on East Chestnut Street downtown ) , but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ( $ 250 per night before taxes ) . The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters , and yes , the view of downtown in the distance was pretty , but I was very disappointed . The bedding seemed to be polyester , not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately . When I ordered room service at 10:30 ( on a Thursday night ) , I had to wait for 55 minutes , 20 minutes longer than I was quoted . I ordered a salad , and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long . Overall , I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower .
I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend , and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels . The spacious rooms with modern , innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small , dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains . The bathrooms were neat , tidy , and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper , shampoo , and soap . The carpet was clean ( not stained and dingy like some hotels ) , the room decor was astounding , and the view from our window was wonderful . I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay , from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out . Thanks for making me feel right at home !
Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at . Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest . The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation . There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself . If it was n't already a bad stay , I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered . If they did n't have air conditioning in the room , I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable . If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business , I hope you decide not to choose this hotel . I was quite surprised , I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience .
I 'd been searching for a cool , non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend . I thought I 'd found a winner in the Affinia ... SOO disappointed ! ! In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults , we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed . What ? ! I was floored , but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride , was too tired to make a fuss . We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night , so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple . I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order ... and nothing happened . I did n't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs . Nothing special ; entree , dessert and NAB for two still came out to $ * ... I am no hayseed , I 'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago , but this just was n't worth it . Our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view ... the bathroom was tiny , shower curtain was stained , funky toilet seat/lid , and the vanity featured that `` rude awakening '' lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms , i.e. , `` Holy crap , have I looked that bad this whole time ? ! '' If you 're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker , they charge for their chintzy coffees ( I do n't use these , but ... come on ) . Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar , but weak drinks ... That night , our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms . But the Marathon was that weekend ; the hotel was so busy I did n't want to be a pest . I ca n't believe I was so impressed with this place online . Next time I 'll happily pay more to stay someplace that 's actually a treat .
Stayed for 3 nights . booked via hotwire , upgraded to historic tower . Got a big room , with a nice view.Service was great . Valet parking was efficient , but you expect it for 53 doller/night . But the location was the best
First let me say wonderful ! ! My wife and i were refered this Hotel by a friend . After traveling to Chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels . We were amazed with the Knickerbocker , we felt like royalty from our first step on the property . Everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable . This Hotel made a routine trip to Chicago a dream Vacation . I can not wait to return ...
I would not recommend this hotel . Although it is in a good area , the room was very small and is getting rather dated . The room had extensive damage . The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling . The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling . The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on . There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile . The room was very small . There was not room for a sofa . Just a small faded chair and ottoman . The carpet had stains on it . Also , the bed was comfortable , but there was not a top sheet , just the bottom sheet and a comforter . Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged . I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space , cleanliness , and value for the money paid .
My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews . For some reason , I kept being disappointed at every turn . Noisy room on the 4th floor . Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling . BE WARNED - No water , no mini-bar no vending machine , no nothing once you get in your room . You might as well be in prison . They have coffee in the morning , but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days . I guess that is convenient for them , but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest . The only treadmill I could get on was broken . Guess what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day . After that nothing . Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver . Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they do n't . They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ( go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free ) . They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach . I have stayed at much better for less . Wo n't be coming back .
I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago . I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom , shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago 's exciting night life . I found The Talbott Hotel 's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for . The price sounded reasonable , so I booked a room . The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together . We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon . After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room would n't be available for another hour . They blamed this on shortage of maids that day . They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe 's but this was n't a good start to our special weekend . When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package was n't in the room . This disappointed my daughter , she was looking forward to that . While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just was n't the surprise we had imagined . The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly . We managed to have a good time together even though the service was n't quite what is claimed on the website . Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again ? Probably not .
Over-hyped and over-priced . The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel . The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they had n't been cleaned ... well , ever . The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed . The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again . The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on . I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there . It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny . my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn ... ..
After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently , I was nothing but disappointed . This `` luxury hotel '' obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable . When I arrived , my hotel room was devoid of towels , and after calling down to the front desk , it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered . On top of that , when I went to connect to the internet in my room , the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their `` superior corner suite '' , I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn , and after this stay , I wish I had .
The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart . As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive , cold hotel.First the room sevice was poorly helpful , the bag boy insisted on a tip , and also droped my bag . The chefs cooking was terriable , the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare , but came to me burnt . The room was not what you pay for , the beds were like a sack of rocks . And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke . I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance .
Was slated for two nights in Chicago , June 12 - 14 , 2007 . I could onyl get the Intercon for both nights . I booked a handicapped room since that was they had left . After reading other reviews of the property , I decided to move it from two nights to one , and stay the second night at the Hotel Monaco . Of course , upon check-in , I was given a suite . Nice room , great linens , clean bathroom , and very quiet . Parking is really high ( $ 48 ) . I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated , but everything was clean and worked well . At , ost , the rooms were a bit dark . I had a late night drink at the bar , which was reasonably priced . i did not eat there , but the menu seemed pretty good , albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected . In all , I thought the place was everything I needed , and was very happy with the room , the staff , the linens , and the housekeeping . Much better than others have indicated .
We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful . First off , the staff is excellent . All of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile . The hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer . All of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room . We decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package . We started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our `` all access pass '' to the aquarium ( very cool ! ) . After our long days of sightseeing ( and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar ) , it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant , but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city . To top it all off , they have the most incredible shower that I 've ever used ( and , even better , it 's all `` green '' ) . What more can I say ? The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable . I highly recommend it !
My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city . We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area . My opinion of the Swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience . The Swissotel has a very 'cold ' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable . The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average . The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel . Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more . Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8:00a which woke us up . We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk . We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel . They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register . He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment . Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment . Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service . Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area .
We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service . We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining . The view from both rooms was spectacular ( as you can tell from the picture attached ) . They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special . The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked , trolleyed , and cabbed all around the area . We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good . The eggs were a little runny , but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station . Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $ 14 ( instead of the adult $ 20 ) The rooms were clean , the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful ... we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we 're in Chicago next time .
Good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well . Front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow . Nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair ( housekeeping staff could/should have reported each day ) - partially clogged shower head , dripping sink , etc . Clean and OK , but neglected - we expected more from an Intercontinental Hotel . Many hotels to choose from in this area of Chicago - can get more for the price from almost any other .
We were encouraged to stay at the Affinia as part of a group in town for a Chicago wedding . We booked our rooms 6 months in advance , with the promise of a brand-new , full service hotel in a great locaiton in Chicago . The lobby was non-existant ( under construction ) . The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful . The hallways and elevators are small , cramped and uncomfortable . The rooms are great - great beds , great television set . NO ROOM SERVICE - the kitchen is under construction . The bottom line is that during our stay , this was NOT a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did . We were totally disappointed , hope it will improve , but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of Chicago 's truly amazing hotels . It is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal .
Recently , I traveled to Chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . The whole experience was wonderful ! The room was spacious and beautiful , and the bed was so comfortable that I had no problem falling asleep , as I normally do at other hotels . The staff were polite and courteous , and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant , I went to my conference with a smile on my face .
I was really excited to be visiting Chicago for the first time , and the hotel that was recommended to me was the Conrad Chicago , located on Rush Street . I wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites , and the Conrad Chicago does not disappoint in that respect . However , everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par , ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room . This hotel does not deserve to be on anyone 's recommended list . My first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in . After asking for three forms of identification ( most places only ask for a driver 's license ) and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to Chicago , she reluctantly gave me a room key . I asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if I wanted to wait , one would be able to help in about 15 minutes . I did n't feel like waiting , so I dragged my bags to the room , only to find that the room key did not work ! Instead of dragging everything back down , I decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk , only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way . I could n't believe I was in the middle of downtown Chicago and the hotel did not have a signal ! I finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room , but I immediately saw there were problems . Two roaches scampered across the carpet and when I went into the bathroom , there were no towels or wash cloths . I went to turn on the TV and it did n't work . One of the lamps was missing a light bulb . I could n't believe that this was happening to me . I was at the Conrad Chicago , not the Motel Six ! I then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy . I was ready to cry . I was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump . I called down to the front desk and asked for another room , but they refused , saying I had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes . I insisted that they give me towels , fix the TV , put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches . They agreed , but told me it would take `` awhile '' because several of their key personnel had called in sick . My stay at the Conrad Chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end . I would not recommend this hotel to anyone
I have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it . This time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed . The hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced . I had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window . The lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright . The bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room . The AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off . Having stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again . Other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer , there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee ( so you could n't walk out with the coffee ) and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay . The construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm , including weekends .
I have stayed in hotels all over the world , and this is probably the worst service that I 've ever experienced . The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would . I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting , was close to the theater , and had what seemed to be a good rate . What a huge mistake . The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful . The room was not clean , the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving , they never bothered to come turn down the beds , and the late check-out `` priviledges '' which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became `` upon request '' - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful . Dont ' waste your time or your money here . At best , it 's nothing special . Personally , I like the Fairmont in Chicago , but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco .
My initial thought of the hotel was , this place is just ok , I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends . I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room . Views were good , its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located . I 'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE . I love all the space they have . Flat tv , traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards . Those are very nice ! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient . I 'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives . In any event , I 'd recommend staying at the Monaco again !
Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is one of the worst hotels I 've ever stayed at . I travel a lot for my job , and it just so happened that this was the hotel the company was paying for . Four star hotel ? Yeah right ! I wish I could give it negative stars I do n't even know where to begin . Normally with these reviews I try to outline the aspects that stood out , but it 's just so overwhelmingly bad . Anyhow , here it goes : To begin with , the customer service stank . You think you 've seen rude service people before ? Well , this is customer service stuff of nightmares . I had a reservation , but I still had to wait for 30 minutes ( yes , I counted ) for someone just to pay attention to me . When she did , finally , she was chewing gum . No visible uniform or name tag . Clearly did n't want to be here . She took one glance at my reservation , did n't enter anything into the computer at all , and told me that they could n't accept it , because the date had already passed . WHAT ? The date for the reservation I had written down was *that day . * I was furious . After a 20 minute shouting match , and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry I could scream , they finally , grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer , so that I could book my room . Then , there was the room itself . On first glance , it appeared clean , but a closer inspection revealed : black mold on the bathroom ceiling , a sink tap that gushed rusty-looking *brown* water , a minibar which was picked at , the remnants looking like they had been there for several years , and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it . The pillowcases also looked yellowed , but I could n't decide if I was beginning to see things , I was already so upset with the place . After an extremely sleepless night of paper walls and neighbors who were , apparently , elephants , I can easily say that I would NEVER go back to that hotel again . Ever . Not if somebody payed me .
I first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where I 'm greeted by name by the concierge . He tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay . He shows me to my room ( paying careful attention to my bags , and ensuring that I need n't lift a finger ) sure enough , the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain , which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they did n't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed . I notice that there 's a display of champagne and cupcakes ( ! ) atop the dresser and my `` experience kit '' which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks , and a yoga mat . namaste . Unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom , I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower , but a jacuzzi , lined with candles of vanilla , deep enough to bathe a walrus . Feeling girlish , I run the water and test before going to dinner . The Hotel 's restraunt C-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you 're dining with the kings of paradise . or at least eating in the Caribbean itself . hmm , I should have brought a date .
I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention ( Feb 27- March 1 ) . The hotel is beautiful . I had a Towers room . I had a decent view of the city ( Sears Tower ) . The room was a little small but had two bathrooms ( 1 King bed ) . The Tower room has it 's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast , evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day . The registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan . The hotel was full but service was excellent . The location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two ( especially toward the El train ) . We loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car . I will stay here again . Hilton offered a Sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay . This made the cost reasonable ( for Chicago ) . However , the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired . The pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink .
During my latest business trip , both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago , Illinois , at one of their Deluxe suites . Unfortunately , and I think I speak for both of us , we were not fully satisfied with the hotel . The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations , and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures , the service is certainly sub-par . When one plans a stay at such an establishment , they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in . First of all , the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on , the air coming out seemed musty . Second of all , the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm . For people who like to exercise after dinner , this can certainly be a problem . Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight . For these , as well as other similar reasons , I would not recommend this hotel , if one is looking for luxury accommodations .
We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much . The hotel is elegant and uber-modern ! Each room simply exudes class . I have never stayed in a nicer hotel , to be honest . The hotel features an upscale restaurant , though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments . There is also a full-service spa at the hotel . The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed ; our dog did n't have to stay at home . How cool is that ? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking , 24-hour room service , 24-hour concierge , shoe shine service , and laundry/dry cleaning . The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile , so that location is absolutely superb . You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world . I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago .
I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James . I had heard from others that it was `` agreeable '' and `` workable '' and `` all right , '' or even `` a nice place . '' I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend . According to the website , I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and `` warm tones . '' Well , when I arrived , I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day . Everything in the front was just a bit too askew . The staff were busy , distracted , inattentive , and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them . I handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort . I also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price . It looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there . The bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly , inexplicably , of men 's cologne . Nobody cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just `` stuck in my nose '' and that it would go away . Well , it did n't , and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived . This ruined my entire first evening in Chicago . For my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel , gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs , and still saved money . And I would not have been treated like such a pest . Needless to say , I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago . I may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels , but I know when I am wasting my money .
Set up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago . They were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company . Naturally , they wanted to stay here . The client really seemed to like their rooms , but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting ( 330 sq ft. ) . In a panic , I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another , bigger , room available . We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success . ( Birdland room is 660 sq ft. ) We have a new client and so does HRH . This is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us .
Stayed at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights . The hotel was clean and tidy , throughout . The Concierge Christopher was excellent and helped as with all our needs , gave us discount vouchers etc . Hotel was in excellent position . 3 blocks from John Hancok Building and more importantly The Cheesecake Factory , Bloomingdales 3 blocks away and the Water Tower Shopping Centre 2 blocks away . We went to the huge I Max cinema which is about ten minutes away . Cant wait to go back to Chicago and The Affinia
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer . Needless to say we will not be returning ! The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get . Upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had . The bed was very uncomfortable and the `` fully-stocked honor bar '' was stocked with only a few choices . The shower did not even work ! We booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi . I would not recommend this place !
I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels , but this place is awful ! ! ! I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left . It is an old , dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more `` botique '' . The carpets are dirty , and tattered ; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet . yuck ! ! ! The bathrooms are tiny , and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them . When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned , we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way . We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table . We told the front desk , called housekeeping , and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum . The elevators are slow , and often only one is working at any given time . I did not find the staff to be friendly at all , except for one waiter @ breakfast . What a disappointment : (
This hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there . By that time , I was so tired I was just ready to check in to my room . I stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk . That was only the beginning . It was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around . I guess it 's because they 're located in the middle of the downtown area , but they could at least make the walls thicker . I do n't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor 's room . The bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it . The toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street . The restaurant food was horrible and I would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger . Overall , I was very disappointed with my stay at the Conrad Chicago .
The location is amazing , right across from Nordstrom 's on Michigan Avenue . The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean . But ... We are Intercontinental Ambassadors ( the rewards club ) and to get to the Ambassador suite level , we have to ride a private `` express '' elevator . The elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor . When we checked in , the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checked-in . Also , there was a language barrier becuase she was Russian . The pool and spa were both beautiful , but we had to pay an extra fee because of `` upkeep '' . If you want a nice hotel all the way around ... go to the Omni .
On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel . When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in . Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with . Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area . Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight . And the room was obviously a room for smokers . The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke . I , of course complained , but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel . After a fitfull night 's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway . Their parents were no where in sight . My shower was cold and had no pressure . I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered . I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it . I can not understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark .
The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in . The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed . When we got to our room , we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room . I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable . The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us . When we went to breakfast , we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived . For the price they were charging , the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere . It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car . For forty dollars a day for parking , we expected better .
The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago . I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting . When I arrived once I walked in , the lobby was beautiful , I could n't hardly wait to see my room . The rooms were just as nice , the bathroom was immaculate ! We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room , even that was nice ! I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself ! I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like , Grant Park , Lake Michigan , Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven , and the Navy Pier , it never really like the normal stressed out meetings . I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I 'm in town .
Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago , I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff . From the moment we checked-in until we left ; the staff , from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating . Since we had our two daughters with us , we booked the traditional double room . The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too . It had plenty of room for the four of us -- or should I say five of us . The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi , our teacup Chihuahua . Fortunately , the Amabassador East allows small pets ( with a pet waiver ) . That made everybody happy ! The location is great as well . Conviently located . Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive . Close to the museums . I 'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago . I 'll be staying here again !
Complete disappointment . Problems : 1 . The alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room . It was constantly emitting low , changing hissing noises . Sooo annoying . And there was no off switch on the damn thing . I had to move the bed to unplug it ( the outlet was wayyy back , buried behind the big bed ) . I kept hearing it , and did n't realize what it was , until it had kept me awake for a few hours . 2 . The shower was ONLY incredibly hot . Turn it all the way cold ... very hot . Turn it to hot , and you get boiling hot . Grrrrreat . So how do I get water that wo n't scald me ? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry , and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water . Good job Omni ! 3 . Hallway carpets are disgusting and old . Walking around , you 'd think you 're in a motel 6 . And my floor had been flooded or something , and they had box fans running in the hallway , 24/7 , to try to dry it out . Talk about an overpriced dump .
Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party , and was disappointed . The hotel is beautiful , the staff was all rather friendly . The main problem was the room/sleeping situation . We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before , but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out ( how that happens I do n't know ! ! ) so they `` upgraded '' us to two `` suites '' with a king and a pull out . First , this meant our party was split up and on different floors . Second , that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch . : ( I 'm not a picky , unreasonable person , but that was the WORST `` bed '' I 've ever slept on ! It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed . Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night ! Just awful ! For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable ! I would not stay here again after this experience .
My wife and I stayed at the allegro this weekend while I was on a business trip . I was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much ( maybe too much ) enjoyed the in-house spa . Rooms service was a bit slow but , overall great hotel would stay again .
On our first trip to Chicago , my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel . In the past from other `` luxury hotels '' we have paid much more and received much less . Here the room were very spacious , comfortable and sleek . We spent come time in the hotel bar , LE BAR , and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none ! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel 's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time . If traveling with a lover we recommend the `` Air of Romance '' package . It was the best ! 6 stars !
I used to stay at the Homewood Suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown . During December of 2007 and this year 2008 I did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if I never left . There is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before . A wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to Chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does ! Its a great place to stay .
This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago . Unfortunately I was very unsatisfied with this hotel . This is a luxury hotel , so you are paying luxury prices . So , I expect to get my money 's worth . Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental . Firstly , my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture . Again , this is supposed to be a luxury hotel , and it 's expensive . I should n't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty . I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted . I 'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it 's a problem in the whole hotel . The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old . Secondly , I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel 's staff . I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive . Thirdly , this hotel has a lot of additional expenses . I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got ( use of the fitness amenities , internet , etc ) . When I 'm already paying so much for a hotel room , I get very irritated when I feel I 'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get . This hotel has a nice looking building , and again , it 's in a terrific location . But I really do n't think it 's worth the expense . There are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better .
For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro . In all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing , I have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than I was at Hotel Allegro . I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon , and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice . Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area , it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet , the service was excellent and the best part , they allow animals . They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty . They have everything you could ever need in a hotel , from in room spa service to a workout center . They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game . If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10 . Id have to give it a 10 many times over . I highly recommend Hotel Allegro in Chicago Illinois and I will be back again .
I found my stay at the Hotel Monaco - Chicago to be less than satisfactory . They lure you in with a fancy website , promising the world and more , but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade . The pictures on the website show a grand five-star lobby and one would assume the rooms match , but when I received my room ( which by the way I could barely afford ) I found it to be no more luxurious than my local Motel 6 . They mention that they are `` pet friendly '' . Let me tell you , that is code for `` smelly '' . There was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and I was awake all night because of the incessant barking . Would not stay again .
My experience as Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was horrible . Me and my wife were on a road trip from New York and stopped had reservations for Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel . We arrived at 12:00 AM and they did not have a non-smoking room available for which we booked ! My wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy . My wife could n't handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else . They refused and were very rude and unhelpful . We had to stay the night , and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel . I will never stay at this hotel again .
My husband and I snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to Chicago , and decided ( at the recommendation of friends ) to stay at the Palmer House Hilton . The only word we can use to describe it is `` amazing '' ! Walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time , it is simply breath-taking . Be sure to check out the ceiling , I have never seen one so beautiful outside of Europe . We checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed I have encountered in any hotel . Everything is in walking distance of the Palmer House , you could n't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown Chicago . Everything was perfect with our stay here , I would not stay anywhere else in Chicago from now on .
A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels . The rooms are very , very well appointed , but not large , and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception . Unfortunately , the service was below average in every way : they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline ; valets did n't deliver the car and had to be asked twice ; the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost , and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue . It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours ! And even after recognizing their shortcomings , not one sincere or significant apology . A poster child of how bad service can not overcome a well-built , well-furnished hotel .
We stayed for two nights for a meeting . It is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean . The service was very good , as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable . The rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses . The restaurant has good seafood , but was a bit expensive . We would come back again .
I ca n't recall another time I 've had to deal with such rude front desk help . While pleasant initially , as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in ( I arrived prior to check-in time , so they were holding a few bags ) , the true quality of this establishment surfaced . Never mind that the luggage was n't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop . While that was a bit annoying , the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna , the very attractive but aloof front desk employee . Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness , as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay , including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning . I also booked a rate that included parking , which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately ; I assume after I got on her bad side . Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk , I felt a phony , uppity attitude from Donna , and I really ca n't convey the extent of how insulting it felt . I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago . The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy . Great location as well . To be fair , most of the staff seemed very friendly , and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier . But I think most travelers , like me , would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service , so as to not have a `` situation '' that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience . Unfortunately , that was the case here .
I 've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times . Like the other Kimpton properties , it 's a classic old hotel that 's been beautifully updated . I found the staff to be cordial , and I really like their corporate culture . They 're pet-friendly ( although I was n't travelling with the dog ) , I got a recycling bin in my room , Aveda products in the bath and they do n't clean with toxic chemicals . The rooms are n't huge and the bathrooms are n't what you 're going to get at a Hilton . What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool . OK , they may be a little pricey , but I 'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily .
The hotel is well located , but the service is poor . They seem to cater to large conventioneers , with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical Fairmont . There are too many specifics to outline here , let 's just say that from the front desk , to the spa , room service which only got my order correct one-day , to housekeeping which did n't even clean my room one day ( although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room . Yep , that 's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings ! They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience ! The hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator . I 've stayed at this Fairmont twice . The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price . But it 's not worth enduring such poor service . That was the last time for me .
A few nights ago , I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago . I 'd heard some amazing things about the great food , and how friendly the staff were . Upon arrival , the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic ! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time ! The rooms were cozy , with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag . I ordered breakfast the next morning , and had room service bring it up . The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering , and was delicious ! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling , or any families staying in Chicago , as the rooms were very reasonably priced , and is a short distance to lots of great sites . Next time I come through Chicago , I will definitely be staying here !
I loved it here ! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here . ( I 've paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel 6 ! ! ) Gorgeous hotel , great staff , fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room . The large windows in the bathroom were the best -- I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline . I remember thinking , `` This is really living ... '' The room was comfortable and quiet , again with great views just like in the bathroom . Chicago is a wonderful town -- I have nothing but good things to say about it . CA n't wait to come back !
We wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner , theater , and my daughter 's 21st birthday . This place certainly fit the bill . It was convenient to everything including the SouthShore Railroad station . The staff were all friendly . Their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee in the morning . Ryan , the concierge , ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of Hershey Kisses waiting for us when we arrived . We were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed , they came promptly to get it set up when we called later . The window seats were beautiful as well and I enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book .
My stay here was superb . The view from my windows was stunning , as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park . The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting . The bed was very comfortable . The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips . THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca . Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here .
My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary . We could not have picked a better locate . The price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget . The flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine . My husband loved the Stetson Steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym . We really did not leave the hotel during I stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away . If we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay . This hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and I . What a wonderful ten years celebration .
I stayed at this hotel for a weekend and I thought it was really nice . The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean . The room also had a beautiful view . It had everything you could possibly need . I almost did n't want to leave the room . It was definitly worth the price . I would go back . The clientel was also very helpful .
Great hotel with beautiful scenery ! The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious . They even had a docking station for my iPod !
The Omni was chosen for it 's location whichworked out perfectly . The bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean ... until ... I sat down in the tub ... there was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder , in the cracks on the walls between the tile , all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl . Needless to say I drained the tub and took a shower ... I really do n't care for showers . Oh yes ... the toilet leaked as well ... The staff were very helpful but I was disappointed . I travel extensively and do n't think I will return . we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken , so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel , printed the presentation and delivered it to our room . They try ! We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building ... but we were n't there too much .
What a terrible experience my family and I had at Affinia Chicago ! First of all , we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 King size bed with a cot . When we got to the room , we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there . What an absolute terror Affinia was and I will never be going back !
My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia . Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel ; not true . Since it was a very special occasion , and also because we were only staying overnight , we did n't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend . However , this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences . I 've ever had . First , the smells : The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy . The odors were not mild , and I found it pretty repulsive . I could n't wait to jump out of bed in the morning , to get away from the odors . Hard to sleep and certainly did n't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary . I did n't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed . At that point , I chose not to contact housekeeping because ( a ) I was exhausted , and ( b ) I did n't want to upset my husband , who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing . Also , the bathroom smelled like vinegar . Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia , but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did . Incidentally , the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days ; not a well-maintained property . Second , the elevators : If you stay above the first few floors , there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar . With so many floors to service , and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday , these elevators took forever to come , and were often full they did . Annoying . Also , on one occasion , there were several bottles ( water and soda ) left in the elevator ; clearly , the maintenance crew does n't inspect and clean the common areas frequently . Finally , and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived . First , when we booked , we asked for as quiet a room as possible . The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital . But , its proximity to Michigan Ave. , and the lack of accomodations elsewhere ( due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end ) , led us to stay here anyway . At check-in , the clerk noted our request , and said our room was quiet room since it was not `` next to the elevators . '' When we arrived at our room , we discovered that we were across from the elevators . Obviously , she was technically correct that we were n't next to the elevators , but it was still so close ( 15-20 feet ) that we could hear the elevator noise . Also , since it was a special occasion , we asked if we could upgrade . The disingenuous , snarky , condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade . Clearly , the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels , this is a matter of routine , not exception . Pretty awful experience all the way around . Other reviewers must have very low expectations . Ca n't explain any of the good reviews otherwise .
We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels ' website newsletter . Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower . Beware however : parking is expensive in the Gold Coast ... . $ 48/night . Right from the start , Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome . Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous . However , it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub , so one call to the front desk and we had another room . All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful , comfortable and well appointed . The rooftop bar is a must-do . The outside patio has heaters and candles , a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views . We did n't sit inside the bar area . Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen , and Christopher ( concierge ) was very helpful . As we left , we shook Victor 's hand ( he 's always there ! ) and told him we 've found our new Chicago hotel !
It 's not a bad hotel . It 's just so ... disappointing . As a Diamond member , I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view . I 'm not distraught over this , but come on . Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge , which has nothing but fattening pastries , bagels and cereal . Low-level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame . And what 's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am ? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30 , not sitting down to their meager breakfast . The in-room wifi is a pain to access , and I somehow got stuck with the $ 19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan . ( Do n't get me started on how a $ 89/night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full-service Hilton & Towers seemingly ca n't ... ) . Finally , what 's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room ? It 's an unseemly waste of space , especially when the rooms are so meager . And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992 , not 2009 , as does the picture-tube TV ( vs. flat panel ) . Overall , this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed .
Great hotel in heart of Chicago for business or pleasure . Rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large . Flat screen TVs , marble baths , all rooms are suites , great desk , kitchenette , comfortable bed , free wireless internet ... everything you could ask for . Location is easy walk to Magnificient Mile and lots of great restaurants . Staff is friendly and helpful . Short cab ride to Loop .
This hotel is totally overrated . Yes , the location is awesome , but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options . The customer service , or lack thereof , was particularly disappointing . Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady ? Even when her hands are full . The housekeeping staff could n't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day . Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you do n't bring it anyway . As stated previously , the location is great . Location , however , does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff . I would not stay here again .
I was completely blown away by this hotel . It was magnificent . I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here . Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay , for example very noisy . However , whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant , it made no difference to me . My room was huge , bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure , bed was perfect and the view was amazing . Hotel is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile , plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park .
What a fabulous hotel ! From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping , to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars , this hotel is one of the best in Chicago . Our room was very clean and fresh , the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful . This is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
This is a review of a first class hotel the InterContinental Chicago . It 's located on Chicago 's famous magnificent mile near restaurants , shopping , entertainment , and historic landmarks . The service at the hotel is first class and the accommodations are unbeatable . The hotel also features really fabulous amenities including a nice indoor swimming pool , fine dining , a 24 hour business center , and valet parking . This is a extra ordinary luxury hotel that will make your stay in Chicago a joy . They offer a number of options on the rate and have a selection of package deals available . Visit their website for a photo gallery and a virtual tour .
A disappointment to say the least . I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out ! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night . The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card , since they do indeed take American Express . I could n't wait to get there ! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon . Me , the tourist , I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding . We get in the line to check in . I give them the gift card and my check card . They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate , but for incidentals as well . We give them a credit card instead . While in line checking in , we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like . The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man . Someone 's luggage has been lost . He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see . Not impressed . We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see . The rooms on the website looked glorious ! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room . The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room . Yuck . We stay the night and go to check out in the morning . Again , I give them the American Express gift card . The clerk says `` their system usually does n't take them '' . I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday . He swipes the card and bam ! it works ! What do you know ? ? He was so rude . I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again , nor would I recommend it to anyone . Such a disappointment !
I visited Chicago with my two teenage daughters . Homewood Suites is amazing . The complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety . The hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop . We got caught in a thunderstorm , and got soaking wet . I dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel ! The Homewood Suites was so much like home . The suite was very spacious and had everything we needed . The hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities . The staff was so friendly and helpful . Chicago is an amazing place and the Homewood Suites is the place to stay . I would definitely stay there again .
My son & I joined my husband on a work trip . We planned to swim while he was working . We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in . Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm . We gave up & went out for the evening . We had a very noisy sleepless night . We were n't facing MI ave , but still heard sirens and I 'm not sure what the other noise was , but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night . I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open , so my ( very excited ) son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction . Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew 's actions & on my insistence she said she 'd look into it . A gentleman called back an hour later & said the pool should open at 5pm ... it was 9am . It is now 6pm & we still have n't even seen the pool . We check out tomorrow . We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to `` swim in Chicago . '' Needless to say we are VERY disappointed .
I recently visited Chicago . I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago . First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel . My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast . The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap `` free '' lunch . My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them . My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in . I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room . I did not feel safe , I had to hide my valuables and I kept the `` BUSY '' sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff . The rooms did not appear as they do on their website , it is actually the opposite . Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn . I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip . I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone .
no bell boys there when you need them , sully staff , no smiles at all in this place . had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff . boy , sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in SF . never here again !
My wife and I just spent a long weekend at the Hardrock Chicago hotel , and although I am not one to normally write long email , I felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat ( 2/14 to 2/17 ) to your attention.Issues included : Our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 2/14 and we never got them . Our friends later ( on 2/16 ) asked us if we had received the strawberries , and we responded no . They then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne . We were then disappointed again , upon checking out , however , when we were accidentally billed for the `` complimentary '' champagne - which was later subtracted from our bill . The in-room DVD player did n't work . It was approximately 11 PM on 2/15 when we called the front desk for help with trouble-shooting the issue . The person responded friendly that `` Al , the engineer , will be calling you back shortly '' to help . 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door , and it was Al . A great and friendly guy , but we were waiting for a call back , not the arrival of a service tech - keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed . When Al was not able to fix the DVD player , he graciously told us `` order a movie on us '' - thru the in-house movie selection . The problem : that did n't work either . Again , Al was awesome , and called the service provider , but they were n't able to fix it until after midnight . Finally , after midnight Al called us back , but by then the `` movie watching '' mood had sort of passed . I ended up watching the film `` Hitman '' alone as my wife had already gone to sleep.The thermostat in our room did n't work , regardless of the temperature we set it to ( set to 65 degrees - actual temperature = 76 degrees ) . We had so many other unresolved issues that we did n't feel it necessary to voice any more . ... read more
I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night , however enjoyed my stay . The staff was friendly , the room was nice and clean , the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant . Room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great . The staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room . Great location too ! Walking distance from the Art Museum , Millennium Park , Grant Park ( right across the street ) and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place . If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again .
O.M.G best hotel ever ! i 've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish . evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed , how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room , the best food i 've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel ! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid 's stayed here . and it 's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . ( all the places to be at least )
If you want the downtown experience of a lifetime , with historical living that will bring you back to Chicago in the early 1900 's look no further , the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay , service is immaculate , and just as you think things could n't get any better , you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in America : Chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife , you are sure to have your excitement whims met , and walk away with the memory of a lifetime . Believe me I did . Valued Customer , Josh
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare ! When we got there our room was n't done ! We were not offered anything to do , drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished . The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone ! How rude ! We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done . And after waiting that long for the room , can you believe it ? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom . The television did n't work , we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it . Plus , the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair . I 'm so mad I 'm writing the owners and letting them know ! This really made me mad . We have n't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs . Even the concierge snickered at my boots , so what , I like to wear Doc Martens ! It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont . At least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame .
We had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids , got only 2 rooms on arrival . 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room . During the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the a.c. , even though we switched it off , it went on cooling , strange ! At night it was very loud from the street . In the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed , not what you need , if you only spend 1 night in a hotel . We came here a few years ago and had it better in mind . The area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places , very good . Clean and fancy . Sorry , but next time we ` ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago .
The reviews we read were a bit mixed , but I thought it was excellent . I 've stayed in The Splendido , Villa D'Este and others and it does n't compare , but nor should it . It does n't claim to be in that space . I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved . A only a small notch too ! . Lovely clean and bright room . Superb views , very quiet , comfy bed etc . Excellent service all round and nice staff . For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed . Could n't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience . We will go there again when in Chicago . Great location too .
I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference . While I have to say that for a conference , some of the meeting rooms were too small , in terms of traveler 's comfort the hotel is exceptional ! I ca n't think of a single thing about my room that was n't perfect . The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions .
Stayed here for two days while attending Lollopalooza music festival . One of the best locations in Chicago , on Michigan Ave near the Tribune and Sun-Times buildings . An easy walk or bus ride to many attractions . The King sized room was very nice , not large , but with a generous bathroom . Service was excellent throughout . Check out the awesome swimming pool , straight out of twenties .
I was looking for an unique , hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago . My choice for hotel was obvious : Hard Rock Hotel Chicago . If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche , they are not . Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern , trendy and hip . It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories , and there are details that you wo n't find elsewhere . For example , one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads ( I got ten ) for guests . It 's a fun place , hosting events such as Jack Daniel 's 160th birthday .
My stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago was amazing . The staff are polite and well poised , eager to give a helping hand in a short notice . To someone like me , who had never even been in the city of Chicago , it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip . The rooms , hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy , and whenver I went out , I would always find my room perfect ; be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences , or just to hit the mattress and sleep . During my stay , I stopped at their restuarant where I had one of the best American style meal in a while . Overall , the Hotel Monaco is a place I would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit Chicago for a second time . It is truely exceptional .
This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure . The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners . The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian . While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula , the Four Seasons , the Ritz and Park Hyatt , it falls short . We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection . While the prices were similar to the Peninsula , we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try . Wow , were we ever disappointed . First off , we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7 . OK , thats fine and we sat down . The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong , so that she could make it right . When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ( $ 20 per glass ) , she consulted with the manager and then another manager ( a heavier fellow in a dark suit ) . She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses . What bothers me is not the outcome , but the fact that the management is not service focused . At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula , this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure , it would be made right . At the Conrad , the Terrace manager just ignored it .
My friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood . Well we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love ! Everything from the colors , the staff , the architecture , and the pricing were AMAZING ! We could n't have found a better hotel . The service was impeccable..talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget ! My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return.. I ca n't wait until then !
Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar . The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby . The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call . Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room . I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wer n't anymore available rooms . She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby . As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper . She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready . I did n't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned . While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through ? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready . I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered . It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels . I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items . If my stay was n't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated . The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online . I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant .
After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel , I can honestly say that I will take the time to book a room , ahead of time , on my next visit to Chicago . We were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was , at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place . The outside of the hotel was pristine , but our room was filthy ! We requested a non-smoking room , but it had obviously been smoked in before , as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air . In fact , we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking , but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well . To top it off , room service brought us the wrong item . When we checked out , we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item , even after we sent it back . I would also have to point out that Michigan Avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class . Right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes . I could n't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because I was too scared to leave the hotel . The pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding , thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to . For the price of the room I would say this place was a definite disappointment . I have learned my lesson to check out the room before I agree to stay in it next time . This place gets 1/2 of a star from me .
My family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 2-5 September 2011 . I have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general . When we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children , take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way . The cleaning crew the next morning did n't even knock at our door before opening the door . My children were still sleeping and I was in the shower . Thank god my husband was already at his conference . The hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience . Louisiana resident .
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in Chicago . Ideal position , lovely quiet rooms , good facilities , complimentary breakfast well received and the Manager 's evening drinks reception excellent ; we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks . The in-house Amalfitini cocktail was very good . The staff were very friendly and helpful . If I ever return to Chicago I would certainly stay there again . Theres nothing bad I can say about this hotel .
We stayed here through Hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $ 60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last May . The room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel , but it was very clean , tastefully decorated and cozy . We had a great vacation , walking all over town until we ended up near the Planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of Chicago and were just wow . So anyway , the hotel is great , the service was great , the room was very nice- I would recommend this hotel to anyone though I work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person 's comment about how she was n't able to get adjoining rooms , well , internet sites do n't guarantee things like that anyway- you 've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that . There 's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed . 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel .
I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel , located on North Rush Street . As part of the Hilton hotel chain , I was confident that I would have a positive experience . Unfortunately , from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out , I was plagued with nothing but problems . When I walked into the hotel , I was not greeted by the concierge , which is usually a bad sign . ( He was reading a newspaper . ) Then , when I announced that I was holding a reservation , they desk clerk was unable to find it . I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system , but they could not find the room I had reserved . Finally , they assigned me a room , but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor . I was very disappointed with the room and its decor . The room smelled of stale smoke , even though it was on a non-smoking floor . The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom . I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago . Surely , this was not the way the Hilton chain operates ! There continued to be problem throughout my stay . I asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late , which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting . I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room , and it never showed up -- at all ! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm , so my shower was short and unsatisfying . I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues . Upon my return home , I wrote a letter to the hotel manager , but never received a reply . Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems , I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again , and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future .
My wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed . It claims to be a luxury hotel , but the air conditioning in our unit was n't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow . We phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of . Noone ever showed up . Aside from that , there were so many kids running around we could n't think straight . This is just my two cents , but I 'd would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options .
Elegant and modernized hotel with great staff . Location is wonderful . The health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout . I will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices .
We booked through a travel website . This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September . The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done . The hallway was so dimly lit , we could n't see how to use the key card . The shock came when we entered the room . Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest 's comfort into consideration . The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress ( rock hard ) over a platform . The `` nigh stands '' were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height . The room was stark - all off-white , no color . No art work or any decoration at all . The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit ; if it were winter and the heat was on , I think this could be dangerous . There was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room ; there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection . The bathroom was very small but clean . The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to . An older person could have never stayed in the room . Because of the renovation , there was no restaurant on-site . No vending or ice available on the floor either I ca n't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel . I would never stay there again .
Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on `` The Magnificent Mile , '' our entire experience as guests there was anything but ... .believe me , the `` magnificence '' ends at the hotel entrance ! From check-in to check-out , our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific . First , there was an error with our reservation , and once we got to our room , we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked , so down I trudged to the registration desk -- where I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes -- to ask for help . The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room ; we were n't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls . Then , dog tired the next morning -- even though we had hung a `` Do Not Disturb '' sign on our door handle -- in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand . Following that rude awakening , I was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife , who , upon entering the bathroom to take her shower , was greeted by an incredibly large roach ! Breakfast -- actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel -- were served cold and were somewhat tasteless . We were routinely ignored by the concierge , who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him . Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in . Of course , there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart . Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was , believe me , the best part of our experience as guests there .
What a gorgeous hotel ! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago . The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better , and to top it off with great restaurants , you could n't ask a hotel for more ! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we 'll be back every time we visit Chicago .
I stayed at the Palmer House for @ $ 150/night on a corporate rate . The bed was excellent , the linens/towels were top of the line . I did not find my room shabby , as other reviewers noted . The Palmer House is over 130 years old . Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture ; I think that lends to the ambience of the place . It is expensive , and I 'm not sure I 'd stay there if my company were n't picking up the tab . But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring .
Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $ 65 a night . The BF and I were amazed when we got there -- the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous ! A nice upscale , downtown feel and super comfy beds . We had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan , a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds , and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times . Seriously . We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay -- which was fine with us . The hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge , sprawling city inside . But we were n't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time ... we like to get out and explore as much as possible . The location was fantastic . Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown . We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab . I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river ( the entrance is right across from the hotel ) -- we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too . Do n't park your car here if you do n't need to -- it 's very expensive . Park downtown or ditch the rental car -- you wo n't need it anyway , you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab . Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel !
Will not stay here again . We were here pre-construction so did n't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing . But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return . Our suite was large enough , but it was dirty , dated and worn . The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly . Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days , disgusting . We ( politely ) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed . We had paid for the King Tut Package , which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit . They had no record of this and did n't honor it . Of course , the exhibit was sold out , so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we were n't able to see this part of the Field museum . My ( also polite ) letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged . Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible .
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding . The service was impeccable . Not only was the staff attentive , they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner . I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy . They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests . The amenities were great , and after an open bar the night before , the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there .
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick before , about 4 years ago , it was ok . The management was great , staff was so kind , and rooms were clean . ** But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back ! ! The new staff was so rude ! ! I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet , and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation ! ** 1 ) I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline . 2 ) Staff was extremely rude ! Not arrogant , but rude ! Like they hated thier job . 3 ) They offered check in at 1pm but the room was n't ready till 3pm ! 4 ) There were stains everywhere ! 5 ) Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site , they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff .
I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased . The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern , stylish rooms . The rooms are something truly special with huge , soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt . The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub . If that was n't enough each room has a crisp 32 '' LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system . When you finally make it out of your room , down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant . It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques . Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile . A full dinner including appetizer , main course , and dessert can be had for $ 45 , amazing . If you are looking for a modern , urban , chic hotel in Chicago then look no further , the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice .
I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel . Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant , to the maid who cleaned my room . The rooms were recently updated , with large flat-screen TV 's , beautiful linens , and exceptional toiletries in each room . My room even had a view of Monroe St. harbor . It is truly a first-rate hotel . Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way ( if that 's possible in downtown Chicago ) , however its location significantly lowers street noise . The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park , the Aon center ( there is a connecting concourse ) , and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave . I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic ! Room service for breakfast was quite good as well . Overall , I 'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop , or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks .
Having made regular business trips to Chicago , I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago , since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there . The Lobby was quite small , which surprised me with a name like Monaco . As a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab.A boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite . It was two rooms , not as spacious as I would have liked , an entertainment room , and a bedroom with a standard television . Can You imagine , I was expecting H.D. , but it was just ordinary cable . For $ 600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set . The bath was ordinary , nothing special , but the bed was a very big King.The view did not take in the Lake , unfortunately , just the Magic Mile . Well , I am starving so time to eat . The restaurant was well appointed , I hope the food was as good . I ordered lamb chops , potatoes au gratin and mint sauce . It was fair . I hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations . I would give this hotel a two and a half , but I would not return .
I really loved my stay at the Talbott . My room was amazing ! The bathroom ( and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms ) had ample room for all of my stuff , which is a bonus for me . The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly . I was afraid that I 'd get a little lost , since it was my first trip to Chicago , but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area ( Rush St./Michigan Ave. -- which are *very* close by ) . The hotel reminded me of those I 'd stayed at in Europe . The room service is 24 hours , which for me , was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights . This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again . For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city , this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable .
My stay at the Homewood Suites was absolutely one of my greatest stays away from home . The locations right in the heart of downtown Chicago . Within the River north shopping district.I love to shop so that was what i needed . Magnificent 2 room layouts with kitchen . The room was fully equipted with anything I needed , nice Flat screen along with a breakfast buffet and a fantastic complimentary dinner and wine . After dinner and wine I enjoyed the comfort of the heated indoor pool so relaxing . I would recommend these suites to everyone I know .
I booked this hotel for a business trip since I was able to get a $ 129 rate on Travelzoo and figured I 'd save my company some money . I had also read excellent reviews on TripAdvisor . I had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in November . When I arrived in Chicago at 7:30pm I decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told `` no problem . '' When I arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm I was told they did n't have a room for me and that I 'd have to move to the Four Points Sheraton which they paid for . It was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away . I was told that they overbooked and did n't get as many cancellations as they expected . I did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience . I would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room ! The `` experience designers '' were great and very helpful . The rooms were very nice and comfortable ( felt like home ) . The breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the `` healthy factor . '' It was nice that they did have fruit . I think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel -- they just need to get the basics down !
We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay . After checking in and unpacking , we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed ( supposedly during renovation ) . The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room . Colleen , one of the managers , was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem . We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed . We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently `` absent from the hotel '' during most of our stay . We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence . We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology . The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident , as was the cavalier attitude of the management .
For the price of the Marriott we spent a night here ( $ 122 + tax ) and had an enjoyable if brief stay . As others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated , and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design . The staff was polite and attentive , and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel . The parking is pricey at $ 49 , so I used an adjacent lot and self-parked , and as others have noted , the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing . Good location . Would return , esp as this pricepoint .
The Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel . : ) Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation , and it could n't have been better ! The staff was very polite and helpful , and the rooms were very clean , and they had some of the best beds I 've ever slept on ! Not to mention the view was amazing ! If I had to rate this hotel I 'd definitely give it five star , next time I 'm in town I will most definitely stay there again !
My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago . We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway . I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us . This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in . But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given . In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover . Very shocking for the price we were paying . When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by . Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess , but I ca n't imagine it is the right flair for many . The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow , designy wallpaper . Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all . I ca n't imagine many would . It really was off-putting . Overall , the experience was a check minus in my book . Will not be looking to return any time soon .
A perfect place for couples to get away too . The location could n't be better , just three blocks from Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile . It 's really romantic , the service was awesome . Very clean and quiet . It has big rooms with comfortable atmosphere , huge bathroom.Over all , i had the a great experience there , would definitely stay there again !
We connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight . The deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included . There was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that . They are currently under major construction . They will be a little late of their projections in the finish date . I must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances . The room was complete and was good . It had a very nice bathroom . The main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food , drink , or rest room opportunities . The construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 9:00am . I think this will be a good one once they are done . As of the end of May , they have a way yet to go .
I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness . The service truly is incredible . They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after . The rooms really rock ( pardon the pun ) . Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets . The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out , but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better . I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets .
My stay at the Sofitel was great . I loved the location it was in . From the moment I arrived the experince was great , the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too . I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable . The room service was excllent and they were very friendly . Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay .
A decent place to stay . The people are nice enough , yet the atmosphere was not what I was expecting . The rooms were not very spacious , nor welcoming . So many places to eat , yet the food was very pricey and average . I would stay here again possibly , but I feel like I could find a better option for a better price .
I am so glad I decided to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago for my first trip to the city . The staff is very attentive , I felt like I was the only person they had to take care of ! The location is great , right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions . My suite was well appointed and very clean . I even looked behind some furniture for dust and could n't find any . The hotel is very luxurious . The sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable . The next time I travel to Chicago , I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again .
Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice , but this was a true disappointment . Check-in was quite slow and problematic ( glitches with their reservation system locally ) . Room was very small and oddly arranged . Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk . Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating ... lobby is not at all inviting , and it did n't feel terribly safe walking around outside . Gift shop was overpriced , even for a downtown hotel . Food was disappointing . Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont i 've come to count on . Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out .
Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago . I was very disappointed in the level of service . 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink , unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant , front desk not aware of room eminities , and a very uncaring MOD ! All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one . I have to give it 2 stars ! ! ! : (
Wow . Here is a place to NEVER hold an event . First , no one smiles , including the bartenders . Does n't anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business ? The bartender was 54 years old . Why do I know that ? Because , she stated to another employee that `` when you get to be 54 years old , you tell it like it is . '' Very specifically , she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things . Wow . The room was set up the wrong way for the event . The food was just plain bad . $ 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good . However , this is the Swisshotel . Oh , let 's go back to the bartender telling us , unsolicited , about all the problems with the hotel . Man , you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business . $ 50 for valet . Ouch . Anyone asking you if you need something , like help ? No . Does management make excuses ? You bet . Do you ever want to hold an event here ? Big no .
We stayed at the Fairmont two Saturday 's in a row , and both stays were disappointing . We had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 30-40 minutes to answer their phone . For the price , we expected nicer decor ( it looked cheaply done ) ; more comfortable beds-the mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hard-pillows were n't comfortable either ; a more accomodating front desk staff . Our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments .
I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting . To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement . I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels . My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style . A fully stocked refreshment center , wet bar , and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items . The Allegro is in the center of everything , the Chicago Loop of the financial district , the Chicago Theatre district , great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel ( I suggest the 312 Lunch Club ) . The fitness room is well equipped and clean . The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro . My next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago .
Upon entering Homewood Suites , I was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel . When I saw my room , I was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay ( refrigerator , microwave , stove , dishwasher , flat panel TV ) . Best of all , the hotel has an on-site fitness center where I was able to work off all of the extra calories I consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast . I could n't resist their omelettes ! The hotel is in the heart of Chicago and I must say , the city view from my room was priceless . Definitely recommended !
I stayed at this Hotel for 1 night . We just wanted to stay in downtown Chicago . This hotel is right next to John Hancock building . Walking distance to many shopping , restaurant , and everything else . From valet people to front desk people , they were all very friendly and helpful . The best thing about this hotel ( other than the awesome location ) is that all rooms are suites . You can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area . You get 2 TVs also . The roof top pool over looking Michigan lake was lovely also .
We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend , but upon arrival our reservation could not be found . I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number , but it still was n't available ! Fortunately , another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us . Once we settled into our room for the night ( after a long flight ) , there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom . Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival . Needless to say , with both of these poor experiences in just one night , I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again , let alone any other Hilton around . Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago !
We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles , dirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom . There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints . The front desk lady said the manager was on a LUNCH break at 7 PM ! ! ! ! ! ! ! We missed our show at Navy Pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc . Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience ! ! ! This was totally inappropiate since I had children including a teenager with me . She gave me a $ 30 compensation for ruining our family holiday ! ! ! ! Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night . They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets . I asked for two blanket , but they delivered one . I had to keep calling to get settled for the night . I saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk , who had taken the trouble of filling it out , but no one collected it or cared for it . Noisy rooms . Can hear the doors open and close all night . The breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished . I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates ! !
Stayed at the Chicago Affinia Dec 10 thru Dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff , the room , and the location . Close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great . Of course , there were many other restaraunts nearby as well . I had a little trouble figuring out the heat , but it was fine once I learned how to set it . They were working on the hotel , so we got a great rate . But the work never bothered us . The room was great , with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise . I would definately stay here again and would recommend to others .
The Palmer House Hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there ! I stayed at this hotel on business and all I can say is WOW ! ! ! One of the main things that I liked about the hotel was the indoor pool ! I loved being able to go swimming even though it was December and 5 degrees outside ! Also , the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings . I dined at Lockwood Restaurant and Bar and the food was amazing for a hotel ! One thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog , but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so I did n't have to deal with that ! All in all , this hotel was fantastic and I look forward to the next time I get to stay here !
Overall , the hotel is beautiful . The service was great . All the employees were friendly and always willing to help . My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River . The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing . The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room . Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be . The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms , so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located .
My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for $ 58 / night . An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water . I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied : `` try running it for 15 to 20 minutes . '' They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower , if anyone else expected to use the shower . My boyfriend , who showered after me , had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again . To make matters worse , after room service was delivered , we called and said we needed another fork . They told us it would cost $ 3 ( $ 1 for the fork , $ 2 for delivey charge ) . Absolutely ridiculous ! ! At least with a 1 star hotel , you get hot water . This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel . I guess you do get what you paid for - I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price .
We have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds . We were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch . Our room was small but adequate . Location was great , close to the L trains and also close to the train station as we always `` walk '' from Union Station .
The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay . I was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated & was in a good location . Unfortunately , it just did n't live up to the hype . `` Recently renovated '' apparently means it was redone in the last decade , not the last year . It was just very tired-looking . Also very disappointing was the food , and the service was hit or miss . I expected better from a hotel of this caliber . Bottom line , there are better places with better value . Stay elsewhere .
This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby . However , when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy . Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty . Wireless internet is available , but that 's an additional fee . Are you kidding ? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free ! Also , the fitness room was available for only $ 15 per day . Wow , I thought the room rate was enough to cover that . When I used the coffee supplies in the room , they were not replenished . I called the next morning requesting more and was told that was n't housekeeping 's area but they would send some up . No kidding , nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar ! Glad I was n't in a big hurry . I 'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I 'm in Chicago !
To start with , this hotel had the worst customer service . They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING ! Now , the problems we had in chronological order . First , we arrive at 8 PM Sat . to check in . They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available , so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway ( free of charge ) . However , the room was not ready yet . Finally at 10.30 ! ( 2.5 hrs later ) we were able to get our room keys . But , there was no rollaway . Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later , we had a rollaway , but had to get the charge waived a second time . Now we go to check out on Mon . and they could n't print us a bill or give us a total . We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $ 2,127.00 ! We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES , for $ 709 each , when our bill was supposed to be $ 450 . After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs , the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home . I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day .
Upon first inspection , Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago , but appearances can certainly be deceiving . Best summed up , Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn . It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain , even if it is an international one . The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $ 50 to tip someone . The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea . The rooms are dirty when you first walk in , the air feels stale , and the views are certainly all they 're cracked up to be . None of this is worth a `` luxury '' price or even worthy of a `` luxury '' name . I will certainly not be staying here again .
Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter & loved it . Staff were helpful & friendly , room was huge with fantastic view of the river . Central location , 5 min walk to the EL . Adjoining Restaurant/Bar , great food & service . I have stayed in more expensive , supposedly better , hotels in Chicago , but this is the best . Thanks Monaco , I 'll be back .
This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood . The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an `` upscale '' overpriced boutique hotel . But it 's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job . Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse , but with all the sleaze removed . Definitely stay at the chain 's other location , the Burnham , for a much , much nicer hotel .
We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great ! ! ! ! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable , given the ticket costs and the Suite . Room was great ... .classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping . NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning . One block from the Washington El train station . We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently does n't like , but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it . Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block . City Hall , Picasso structure ... .this was a great place . Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service ... reasonable . Omar is a super guy .
We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago . It is a stately building . But this year , there were ... problems we have not had before . First , they now have wi-fi available , but it is not free . The cost is $ 7.50 per hour . On-line it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about $ 4 , but this was almost double . Many hotels have free wi-fi . Wi-fi is wi-fi , so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost . They also charge for their fitness center , even when you are only going to use the machines . There is no business center in-house for copies , etc . Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room . It did not separate us from the bathroom noises . When someone took a shower ( at 5:30 a.m. ) , the pipes `` sung '' like old pipes do , but very loudly . An empty wine glass sat outside someone 's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping . The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line . If you called down , you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line . The staff were all very nice , and the location ca n't be beat , but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year . I doubt we 'll return ... .
We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience ! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago . We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained , luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill . First of all , the hotel is all suites . We stayed in one of the `` Premium Suites '' . The accommodations were definitely luxurious , with premium bedding , very nice robes for our use , and a choice of pillows . We used the hypo-allergenic ones , but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers . We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma , we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we do n't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home . There were actually two TVs in our suite . There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access , a wet bar , an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside . The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile , with so much to do practically at the Omni 's doorstep . I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage , which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite . The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin . It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni . It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended . I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly , recommending several excellent area restaurants . However , we think our best meal was at the Omni 's 676 Restaurant , where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass . They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff 's guidance . Lastly , the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago , which was a highlight of our trip . We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni ! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future , where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again . We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience !
After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel . The problems started in the parking lot , yup before I even got in . There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage , broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble . Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room . The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out . The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking . When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed , the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on . This was only the beginning of our terrible stay . Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long . The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass . We could not check out soon enough ! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip .
My stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days . I never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel . During my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge . In fact , they did n't charge for WIFI , morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service . The lobby always had complimentary coffee , tea , soda and meals ! I felt like a queen . This hotel deserves highest marks for service .
Just what I needed at James : I ca n't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel . I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend . The crisp , clean , contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work . It was luxury without being over the top . My room was clean , comfortable and was above all standards comfortable . In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the `` JBar '' , and I highly recommend dinner at the `` David Burke Primehouse '' The customer service from all the staff members , from front desk , to house keeping to the bartender was excellent . I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience .
Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . Rooms are small , dirty , and in no way represents the web sites representations . Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment . At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago , `` please '' avoid this one . I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms .
Chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit . Some friends suggested trying The Talbott . I 'm delighted we took them up . The Talbott is a great `` small '' hotel a block and a half off of Michigan Avenue near the Four Seasons , Drake and Westin . The concierge staff was most helpfull . Gene and Stephanie took great care of us . The rooms were spacious and very fresh . The elevators could be a bit slow at times . Aside from the construction next door , our stay was perfect . Bice now runs the hotel restaurant . We enjoyed having breakfast there . We will stay there again .
We had a great experience at this hotel . The hotel is Huge ! The rooms were very clean , well appointed , and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park . The Staff was so nice and very helpfull . Donald , at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance , and on a Holiday weekend too . They were great seats and a reasonable price . He worked very hard for us to see that show . They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration . This will be my first pick when I return in the spring .
A hotel made for royalty . Decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of , it is an amazing experience ! It 's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago , and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience . The customer service was fantastic , as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own . A beautiful experience that I would certainly do again !
I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip . We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded . We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city . The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service . The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more . Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site . The hotel 's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses . Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable . Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt . Being of European descent , I enjoyed the croissants , whole grain muffins , real butter and marmalade . We also brought along our Standard Poodle , Sterling , and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family . We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings . Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling `` at home '' while away . For pet lovers this is a big plus . Finally , transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal . This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this , another appreciated bonus of our stay . Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience .
The hotel lost our reservations and then couldi n't accommodate what we needed . they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request . we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations , they still charged us an early check out fee . If it was n't for the great location of the hotel , there would be nothing positive to say/
I decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the Monaco because of the website 's pictures of the beautiful rooms and views . It was a waste of cash , to say the least . Although I had requested a room with a view of the city , they must have given me the worst room in the place . Maid service skipped over my room on my second day there , and I had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room . The food was outrageously expensive and not even lukewarm . Two-star hotel quality .
We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown . We where woken up at 6:00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded , this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet . We where moved to another room , but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for . The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets , coffee or towels , which is just horrible service . The service along with the orginal room where perfect , but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel .
The entrance and room was spacious and modern , yet elegant . It was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of Chicago . The drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds . Indeed , it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots .
Stayed 5 nights at this great hotel . Updated rooms . Clean . Used Tim to book theater and dinning reservations . Provided excellent service . Close to subway , shopping and dinning . Excellent value . Free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks . Highly recommend it . Future concern is adjacent construction of condos . Not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future .
This hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion , and I really enjoy everything thing about it and I also have many different reasons why I like this hotel . From the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms , everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has . I completely am astonished by this building and if I had to pick one to compare with this one I really would go for this one . It 's like a person would have to see it to believe . It has a lot of modern designs . Thank you and this is my review and it 's real .
We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website , read about their `` romantic weekend getaway . '' Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really did n't know what to expect , but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be . Upon arriving , the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car , unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic . It only went downhill from there . The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we could n't figure out what it was . We ended up getting a different room , which was very mediocre . Needless to say , we wo n't be staying here again .
My husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend . It was far from that ! We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain , the person who answered the phone was extremely rude ! We were unable to relax at all ! Also , the room was not very clean , there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock . We will not be returning to this awful place !
We had reservations ( guaranteed by credit card ) for 2 nights this past weekend . When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town . I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning . They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us . The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way . Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer - something we were never given . Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys did n't work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel . So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton . In addition to all of this , we had to pay $ 24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation . I am still shocked by this bad experience .
I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out . I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it . I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me . They were not accepting responsibility , but talking down to me as if I was stupid . After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower . This was not a service person . He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having . He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one . Nobody came up after that . I was told I could switch to a different room , so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor . The shower did work in this other room , but I did n't have the view of the city that I had in the first room . I was looking at a brick wall . Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night . I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise . This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable . Do not go to the Omni Hotel . I 've stayed in $ 50 a night motels with better service .
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway . Upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place . One encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately . the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected . Everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication . Training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers . I am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was . I was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment . I hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved . However , I do not plan to return to this hotel again .
