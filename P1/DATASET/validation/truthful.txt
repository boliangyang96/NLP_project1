I stayed for four nights while attending a conference . The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St. , but just off the busy streets . The room I had was spacious , and very well-appointed . The staff was friendly , and the fitness center , while not huge , was well-equipped and clean . I 've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago , and this one is my favorite . Internet was n't free , but at $ 10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels , and it worked very well .
we love the location and proximity to everything . The staff was very friendly and courteous . They were so nice to our 2.5 year old boy . got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived . We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . Ca n't beat that ! the only minor issue is the elevator . we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . Otherwise , it was a great stay !
I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says `` free breakfast '' included in the price . However , what they do n't tell you , is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit ( or two ) ! Moreover , you need to ask for these `` tickets '' at the lobby when you check in - they wo n't give them to you automatically ! We stayed there over Christmas '03 , and we , and I noticed several guests who bought the same package , had a rather unpleasant experience ! The hotel is nice though , if you do n't consider their lousy service !
Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker . Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping . Hotel is in a great location . North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away . Staff was very nice and professional . Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful . Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets . We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room . Good size room , with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed . Bathroom was somewhat small . Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day . Did not eat at the restaurant Nix , but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar . Overheard comments saying the food was very good . Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow . Martinis run $ 9 and up . Very good drinks and they do n't shy away from the liquor . Valet parking was $ 35 a day with in/out priviliges . Overall a great stay . Would definately stay at this hotel in the future .
My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July , 08 . We had ( 3 ) 1 bedroom suites . Great Location in downtown Chicago . Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions . The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly . The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded . I recommend going early . The rooms were quiet and clean . I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying > 2-3 days . We would stay here again . Parking is expensive , about $ 28/day . It is valet . The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $ 24/days so we did valet parking . The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly . This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites ( 3 different cities ) . I have had a great experience each time .
i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror . They admitted it was their fault , and now they wo n't pay the $ 500 to fix it because we ca n't prove it was not broken before ! ! ! the hotel is wonderful , the rooms are new and nice , but we will never stay here again because of this ... .Be sure to inspect your car before you leave !
great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE ! Wonderful lobby ! AND THAT 'S IT ! The room was old in style and furnitures , the tv was from the other century , no minibar , no wireless internet , no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room , those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections . small room , small bathroom , rude service room . they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars . Robbery in the business center , 0,59 cents a MINUTE for internet connection , you have to pay to use word , or excel . NEVER AGAIN !
Named my price on priceline . $ 50.00 Bucks . Hotel room was great . Clean , Clean and new . Fresh crisp sheets , comfortable bed , flat screen TV , clean carpet , nice bath , etc . Short distance to food and sightseeing . I highly recommend this property . Be prepared to pay over $ 40.00 per night to park . Hey , Its a hyatt . They also charge $ 5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck . For a total of $ 100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just do n't drink the bottled water . Happy Travels
I never write these reviews , but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the # 1 2008 travelers choice . Terrible Service , Lazy Doormen/bellmen/concierge/valet , Lack of Respect , allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints , Phantom charges to room , front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus . The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son , and the doorman watched on doing nothing . Me and my girlfriend are young , look young in how we dress , but in all honesty make more money than most ... and we were treated like cheap poor kids . I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up , the concierge exclaimed that , `` You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr . Blank ? '' Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $ 200/person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young ? Very Dissapointed . Very nice looking , comfortable beds , great room service , contemporary , younger crowd , but service was terrible .
My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists . What a beautiful hotel ! Our room was lovely , the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient . They do n't have an in house gym , but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street . The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast . The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there . We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel , as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods . There are tons of great restaurants in the area ( including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower ) as well as lots of shopping . There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott ( they are building condos right behind it ) , but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago .
This is my second time here in two months ; both stays were great . The rooms are very nice and very clean . The staff is terrific and always attentive . My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk .
If I did n't have to stay here , I would n't . Without exception , I swear I am not lying , every day of my stay brings a new problem . Over the past 3 months , I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ; problems every time . From the wrong food with room service , to room keys that dont work , unrefreshed bath towels , forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service , unclean ice bucket overnight , forgotten room cleaning , inability to connect to the Internet ... .I 'm too tired to keep writing all the problems . For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel , I expect more . Finally , their team is certainly not trained in customer service . The front desk teams have attitudes , and Aria 's hostesses think they are something else . I 'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon , but I would never go back if I had a choice . The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding .
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago . We decided to stay at the Talbott , and we reserved a room there over a month ago . I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful , but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . We were given room # 1605 . Avoid this room at all costs ! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night ( and then awaken you at 6 AM ) . In addition , we had requested a king bed , and # 1605 has two doubles . We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . Despite the very friendly staff and its super location , the Talbott was less than what we expected , and we would probably not stay there again .
I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James . Service was impecable , from the door man to the front desk . Location could not be better . Yes , you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor , but , come on , you are downtown , what do you expect ... .Overall noise was not in a level to bother us . The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm ... PM not AM ? Go figure ...
My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad , not really knowing it 's location . We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. ( It 's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown . ) Great for shopping . The hotel itself was fabulous . The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants . I recommend going to Joe 's that 's right across the street from the hotel . Everyone was raving about it . . .but we could n't get a reservation . The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere . My husband loved the workout room . I highly recommend the Conrad ! !
If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you 're willing to pay a little extra , I 'd recommend this place.Also , pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.A short walk to Michigan Avenue . Excellent service from the valets , concierge , lobby agents , and waitstaff in the restaurants . The food in the restaurants was great and room service was n't too shabby either.Well worth the money !
Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night 's sleep I 've ever experienced in a hotel . Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment . Sofitel is worth the extra $ 's .
We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights , a wonderful place.Room was on the 29th floor , absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.Breakfast perfect and service really good.People were always helpful.It 's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop , but in front of the hotel there are buses ( number6 ) waiting there next turn , not a real bus stop , but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel .
For a supposed 4-star hotel , I was not very impressed at akk . The lobby was nice and modern-looking , but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors ( we did n't arrive that late at night ) . Additionally , when we walked into the hotel late one night , there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and , it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . Where was the staff to clean up ? That 's not a very welcoming sight . The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view , but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue , andi it was also a little too far south . Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night !
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor , there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights , beat up and old dorm style . It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely . All night there are chimes that make noise , that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you , I paid for the wifi , and still we were unable to get on . Lastly , my sister and I split the bill , I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit . Room cost with city taxes etc . was 313.69 a night . I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper ! So while the View was wonderful , it is NOT worth the money .
This was our third trip to Chicago this year ( we LOVE the city ! ) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . Swissotel was definitely our favourite . When we come back in July to see the play `` Wicked '' for the second time , we will be again at Swissotel . No more need to try other hotels ! The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile . The room was spotless and quiet , the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . Comfortable beds , friendly service , not as many noisy sirens ! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! This was the best anniversary ever . We would recommend Swissotel to everyone !
We stayed here because of all the great reviews , and it 's all true . We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything , everyone , and the location . Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . Gibson 's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple . This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . It should also have more than three stars . I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard , and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those . Depending on the room you get , any price under $ 250 would be a good deal . Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it .
After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo , I decided to give this hotel a try . I must say it was a great choice ! The location is perfect , just off from N Michigan Ave , walking distance from everything . The staff was very helpful and friendly , and the room was excellent . They gave us a corner room w/a great view . As many have posted , the bed & pillows were very comfortable ( I am very picky about that ) . I slept well every night ! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit . I highly recommend this hotel .
I stayed here for business and loved it . Got it for $ 93 inc tax on Priceline , an incredible deal for this hotel . If I was n't on priceline I would expect to pay $ 200 per night ( maybe more ) for this location/level of service . It 's in the heart of downtown Chicago , walkable to many locations . The lobby is very impressive , the room was very nice . No complaints at all , from check-in to check-out . I was alone so did n't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . It was full of people all the time . I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city .
Firtly they took $ 372 off my card , even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . They had no business taking the money off of my card . So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake . It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . When I looked a week later , they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate , so two of my friends did n't come to the trip away . Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound . After about 8 phone calls over 5 months ( each saying they would ) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 . Overall , the hotel was nice and in a nice location , but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems .
Beautifully appointed , professionally staffed , comfortable , well-located , and elegant , with wireless internet access ( plus free access in an alcove on the second floor ) , fitness center ( a little small but fine if you use it at the right time ) , good energy clientele , easy access to Michigan Avenue , next door to 24-hour restaurant , 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks , elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything . Will definitely return !
My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in Illinois . We were only in Chicago on our way home . We did n't know where to stay in Chicago , but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide . We 're glad we did ! We enjoyed our stay very much . Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city . That 's what we wanted -- a great view , and we got it . Also , the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop ( we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it was n't bad -- saved us a lot of money ) . The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available . We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating . The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago . We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night . We would definitely stay there again .
We live down the block from the hotel . We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there . I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . The lobby is elegant . The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . The location is the best residential area in the city ( as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away ) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street ) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area ) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . I paid less than $ 100 including tax for one night . I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around .
I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip . The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great . I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny , but ours was perfectly fine , with funky , fun doors . The decor is a lot of fun . We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise . The front desk staff was very friendly , and before we even made it to the desk , a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival . We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier . For people who were upset about no free coffee - there 's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away . I definitely recommend this hotel !
Great , awesome service . Seriously , the people are amazing . That , and the nice bartender who serves after last call ( at least , that 's what I was told - I of course do n't drink ) save this place from one star . But seriously blah , small , non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $ 725/night , even in a major city , the rooms better be awesome . I 've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $ 350/night . ( Good thing I had a corporate rate . ) And my room was not especially big , despite what the below reviews say . But here 's the main problem . Even on the 10th floor , the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 , and 6:15 , and 6:30 , and 6:45 , and 6:50 , and 6:55 , and ... and , well , I finally got up and said screw it , let 's greet the day . Maybe everyone else was already up , but somehow I doubt it . Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons .
I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it ! The staff are great , the rooms are spacious and clean , and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership ( for free ) you get free wireless internet access .
Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business , was looking forward to stay . Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite , they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom , lamp fixtures literally falling off wall , mirror torn off wall , etc . Ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer , but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . Only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors , so you can be stuck waiting for ever . When I raised this to hotel staff , was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . Umm , no . This is not an old building problem , this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . Thumbs way down , stay away . Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm , sans hassle .
My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference . We stayed in a spacious suite . All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape . The bed was very comfortable . Views were great . I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights . The room was so quiet , it was very relaxing . We ate in the restaurant downstairs ( Aria ) and although pricey , it was excellent . The staff were consistently attentive and responsive . It is evident that everyone is very well-trained . I would love to stay here again .
I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business . It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable . The rooms are spacious , great beds , pillows and linen . The bathroom has a great shower and bath . WiFi works really well and the desk is large . The staff are wonderful . The location is great for shopping , spa 's , Starbucks and hairdressers . I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it .
The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel . The carpet was exceptionally worn , wallpaper peeling , bathroom grout dingy . The place felt like it had n't been redecorated in 30 years . On top of that , the windows would not open ( not unusual for a hig-rise hotel ) , and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work , I have no idea ( they said 'radient cooling ' whatever that is ) , but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation . We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated . So much for privacy . I ca n't comment on the food , because we ate out at every chance . Chicago has some fantastic food ! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . The hotel is in a good location , near the waterfront and millenium park , shopping and dining . The conference facilities were average , but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent . I will never stay in this hotel again , especially for the price , because of the poor room quality .
I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago , an older hotel with a great reno ( a bit over-the-top design , but still very lovely and charming ) , clean rooms , and very friendly staff . They 're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag ( treats and directions to an off-leash area ) , and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog 's names on it .
October 3rd , 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 . The hotel is VERY modern . The room was immaculate , but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA . It was chipped in many places . The light switches were difficult to find , and the HVAC made noise . However , the bed was wonderful . The bathroom was large and well maintained . Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . The restaurant was small . You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo . If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel . However , after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel . Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full . When we checked in , we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals . Upon returning home , we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it . This reduced the line of credit , and it took several days to be removed from the card . Great location ! Reasonable value . If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon .
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March , 2006 . We had a great time ! We were upgraded to a suite , and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr . Bubbles , animal print robes , and a luxurious king- sized bed ! THe suite was very nice , and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street . It was very boutiquey , and the lobby was lovely . We enjoyed the complementary wine hour . The staff was attentive , and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable ! We would return here !
My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question , and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while . The rooms were well decorated and spacious , although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . I would definitely stay here again !
This was a great place to be ! Great views of river and lake , walk to everything , a clean and comfortable room , and very accommodating staff . We arrived early and were checked in by 10:30 am and checked out late , effectively adding two days to our vacation . It is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers .
Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel . Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour , and the accomodations were quite nice ( our beds were very soft and comfortable ) . We had excellent views of the river from our rooms . The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town , with easy access to public transportation nearby . My friends actually received the goldfish upon request , which they enjoyed . Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above , but it was minimal . Price seemed very resonable to us for the location . Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again .
Move beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location . Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . Thank goodness the window opened or we 'd have been cooked alive . That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting . Room was stuffy too . Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions . Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath . Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey .
In my experience the Ambassador hotel did n't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment . The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . The carpeting was very old and worn . The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . Currently , it 's indespirate need of renovation .
We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion . The room was clean and new feeling , nice city view , free bottled water in room upon arrival . Check in was a breeze , and our room was ready even though we were several hours early . All staff was friendly and helpful , excellent breakfast .
While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before , this was my husband 's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation .
This hotel is rather stupid to be frank . It 's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional . The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there is n't much in them . I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink . I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days . It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors are n't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night . On a good note , the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . That 's about the only good thing I can say about this place . I would not go back .
I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment . Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel . If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms does n't go down past 74 , the closet is 24 '' wide , all old/dirty brass fixtures , beds that are a little bigger than a twin , showerheads that barely put out water , then this is your hotel . I might be spoiled by staying in Marriott 's , but I stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted . No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again .
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day , I left the hotel , crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab . I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . After doing so , I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . As the cab slowed to pick me up , the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . When the cab stopped , I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman . After locking the door , the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs , he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a `` jerk '' before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . Consequently , unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen , please do n't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . Lastly , as for the rest of my stay , you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English . While I have nothing against the French or French language , I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . Viva la USA !
My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount . The valets were really friendly , you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level . That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street . The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative . Our room was very clean . The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants , storing and reheating food . The complimentary breakfast was great ! They have real food such as eggs , bacon , french toast , cereal , bagels , juice , milk , and yogurt . The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue . They also have free WiFi . Overall , I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others .
my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york . The room was very spacious and clean , the bed was huge and extremely comfortable . I really liked the Aveda bathroom products , great smell . We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot . Compliments to the chef . The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier , directions were given to us accompanied by a map . The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show , this was spectacular . The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park . Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping . If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here .
The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels . It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee . The robes were not in the room and it took a long time ( hours ) but other than that a great place . The concierge was excellent .
Arrived at 1:30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel . If you party and stay out all night anyway , this hotel would be fine . But do n't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in . She was fine with me and gave me a corner room , but sure would n't want to be on her bad side .
Check ins went smoothly . But be advised ... . Walls are super thin , the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out . For the price it was n't bad . It was walking distance to most major attractions . Overall ... it 's ok at best . Another plus is the CTA is close by .
We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end . Bad cheap furniture , carpet that stops short of reaching the wall , a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew . BAD BAD experience . Find aother hotel plenty in the area .
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete . The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5:30am and goes on into the night . Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24/7 . Worst of all , the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating . Ugh !
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance , yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise . I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day . The next morning , prior to being moved to a quiet room , the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood . About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street . The room was quiet but smaller and darker . The mattresses in each room were very firm , I would even say hard . I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same . At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under , and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes , which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside , with other passengers . ( The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later . ) As recompense for the noise , flood , etc. , the hotel offered exactly nothing . Not a great stay .
The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up . I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel 's iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up . Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower . The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately . Also , they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers .
On our visit to Chicago , we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown , within walking distance to most major attractions , such as Sears Tower , Magnificent Mile , Grant/Millenium Parks , etc . Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice , clean , and at a great location . Was in a safe area . Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play . I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again !
We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year 's in 2008 just to get away for a few days . We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap . So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again . It also included parking at the great price . Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago . Best location to walk EVERYWHERE . My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows . Ca n't wait to go back .
Apart from the location , great , but it stops there . Upon check-in , I was informed I would have a queen bed . I asked for a king size bed , and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king . GIVE ME A BREAK , a surcharge for going from a queen to a king . When I got up to the room , it was like a oven . I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service . Everything in the room had a charge associated to it , even down to the coffee , $ 1.00 . Now what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom . Very small . I have stayed there twice and with so many other options , I feel this will be my last .
I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago . A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate . Cheaper than even a fleabag motel . So keep an eye out for specials . The view was great , the location was prime . The staff was helpful . The room was large ( we had 2 double beds ) . I only have one complaint . Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees ( I think ) would sneak off to talk on the phone . The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day . Fortunately , the sound was only in the bathroom so it was n't like it kept us up at night . It was just a little weird . Overall , a great stay and I will definitely stay there again .
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women 's hospital oir my surgery . Few things I really did n't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors.No noise insulation at all ! Very dusty between window frames ( I understand - cars , pollution ) but it looked like it was n't cleaned for a very long time.One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side . I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time ... We did n't notice the problem until very-very late.The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper.Affinia did n't even offer that.Looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Hopefully , no more surgeries for me ... Wo n't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount !
Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations . I had no idea it would be so large , so nice and with so many amenities . I also did n't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute . We were met at the door by the friendliest staff . Even with a long line at check-in , the entire process was about 10 minutes . We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV , decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant . Paid $ 200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago . We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale , but we also paid over $ 300/night there .
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok . The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center , which is truly annoying . In addition , there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator . Other than that , it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm . But , the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable . The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk , and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed . There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed , so they shoved it off to the side . Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel . It should not be sold as a hotel room .
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back .
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting . The hotel has some elegance in the lobby , meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating . I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch . My car was misplaced during valet parking , our reservations were messed up , hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items ( room service , a new coffee pot , laundry ) that was n't ours . I would not stay at this property again . There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave . It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers .
If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways , then this view is for you . I asked for a room facing the river , I get a room facing a Brick Wall . That really pissed me off . From all the great reviews , I was expecting better . Before I came here , I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC , and that was awesome . There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . The wine hour was ok . I was hoping there would be something better food , but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour . I ordered room service one night . There was n't really anywhere to eat it , so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . This was my first time coming to Chicago , and I think it will be my last . Just thoroughly disappointed .
Booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE , and was rather disappointed . Bed was either the world 's smallest queen , or was actually a double , not to mention it was uncomfortably springy . Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used ( q-tips ) . Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly . When the tv was off , there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv . Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower . It is in a great location , however , next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott . This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business , but I would n't recommend it for a romantic night or two .
Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09 . Chechecked in about 9:15 AM . Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made . Room was quiet , and comfortable . Marked improvement over last time I stayed there ( about 5 years ago ) . The renovations were great , and maintained the old time charm of the hotel .
Be prepared the hotel is old . It is on the historic list . The is updating to be done no doubt.. So just be forewarned . It is clean and the staff is phenomenal . Having said that , you can not beat the location . Right in the heart of the Gold coast . Take a train from O'hare right into the city . It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel . One block from the beach and public transportation is right there . Incredible area to explore . I highly recommend the Ambassador East
My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one . I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor . When I arrived , I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk . I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone . The room was very small and dark . Then the Internet was n't working . I was n't informed about this on my check in and could n't be given a time frame when it would be back up . I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking , gathered up my belongings and went there . If you 're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels , you 'll lurve this place . But if you like a hotel with lights on , working internet and a good view and real breakfast , go someplace else .
this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago , and I 've been to this hotel at least 4 times . the rooms are clean , wonderfully designed and comfortable . The staff is friendly , service focused - and the restuarant is great , especially for the breakfast fruit crepes . Love this hotel . It 's a great location , very good and consistent service and quality .
My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews . They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff . They sent engineers three times to repair the unit , and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it was n't , under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty . At my parents ' request , the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort . The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room . Do n't book this hotel in the summer . And by the way , there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings .
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back . One more thing , in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table . Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding . They need to update this piece of furniture .
Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time ... . 1 . Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby ... no warning . not on the website ... `` thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site '' 2 . Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area ( 25 min wait ) .. check in..ACHE conference -- be prepared for the influx of people for the convention . 3 . Double book room ... . go back to check in ... told to get back in line ... and we will review when it is your turn ... told them I just waited 25 mins.. Curt service worker said wait your turn . 4 . Second room ... dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM . 5 . Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network ... . 6 . Second day and Third day stay ... No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower ... . 7 . Check out ... overcharge on bogus fees ... . Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont .
We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .
I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro . However , our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful . The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another . The bathroom was small but well appointed . Overall , it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased . Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway . One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I ca n't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe . The area is also very close to public transportation ( we used the trains exclusively ) and got around quite well without a car . We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others .
Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two . The staff are consistently friendly , polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door , servicing the rooms , managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk . They genuinely seem happy to be working here and ca n't do enough for their guests . The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other ( we did n't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy ) . The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave , or catching a bus or subway . There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks , which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc . My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot ' for a huge variety of beer . Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites , because we would n't stay anywhere else !
Perfect location , clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay . Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile ) and restaurants . Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family , friends or on business . The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door .
I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business , and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city . The location was perfect , walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff , and literally 100 yards to the L ( red line ) for getting out to the surrounding areas . The room was great : not exactly 'wow ' decor but clean and really well stocked . I was expecting a 'suite ' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area . It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment , with an open lounge/kitchen , bedroom , and bathroom . Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed . Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover ( ! ) , and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed .
Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel . The `` amenities '' were a smoke screen , nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn . I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase . Being charged $ 15/day for Internet on top of a $ 250/night rate was a bit over the top . The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient . The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head , unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost . The staff were friendly and helpful , actually the best part of the stay were the staff . All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room .
Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis ( not including our business travel ) . We 've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . We were not at all impressed by this hotel . At $ 220/night we were expecting a decent , clean hotel but obviously not a 5* . We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given ( 1546 ) . The paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling , there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room , the internet service was extremely slow , the toilet ran throughout the night , and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was `` I know , we ca n't wait for our renovations . '' If it had n't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK & booked into this hotel by a travel agent , we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow . All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff . In its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation . Despite its location I can not understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . We would never book at this hotel again .
Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company , but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel , I thought we should give them another try . Turns out my first impression was correct , this is the LEAST friendly hotel I 've ever been in ! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable . I could go on and on , but instead I 'll just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !
Reservation was for a King size bed , instead I was given a double-bed room . Check-in person must had a bad hair day , because she was unfriendly . Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary . Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator , but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy . I did n't bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire . I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental .
We stayed in the IC chicago for 6 nights from 26th Dec after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor . We werent disappointed . We had 2 rooms opposite each other in the Historic tower . The rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building . We got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $ 17 per day . As the hotel is on the Magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast . The starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy . I would definitely recommend the hotel .
After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed . I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $ 170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens . The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El , Millenium Park , the Theater District and Shopping . The room was clean , a little larger than standard and nicely decorated . We had window seats in the room with a view of the river . There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening . To top it off , the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area .
I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite . No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals . The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table ( ! ) and canted forward . Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer . Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos , I have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property . Bed was fine and bath was fine but I ca n't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well . The couch/futon seating is the worst I 've encountered in a modern hotel .
Excellent location , about a block from Michigan Ave. and two blocks from Water Tower Place and John Hancock Tower . Beautiful hotel , felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel . Staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating .
Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief , they need more than two elevators . You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor ( registration desk on 6th floor ) , you can face a long line just to catch one . Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites - very utilitarian ; unlike many locations however , this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms . The pool is OK but there 's no jacuzzi . Oh , and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area . Front desk service is pretty good .
All I can say is avoid this place at all costs . From the reservations assistant ( who took 45 minutes to book a room ) to check out ( they billed my card for 750 dollars ) and getting a refund ( numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call ) . AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again , and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement !
I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues . Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day . No fridge or microwave included in the price . Our room had two too soft full size beds . In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall . Who doesnt believe it , check out the 16th floor close to room 212 . With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous . I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better . The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty , but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served . please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby .
My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel . Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space , great jazz CD 's in the room , wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I 've ever slept in . The staff was very helpful with every request . The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry 's , fruit 's and jucie 's . We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta 's for their guests . Would highly recommend this hotel .
I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops . The service at the hotel is first class . The rooms are modern and very comfortable . The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants . Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples .
Check-in was fast , the room was perfect , and there were no problems . This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable . I got a very good deal for a one-night stay , but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet . If you are bored of the routine hotel fare , walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry ( 155 N. Michigan ) for a refreshing change .
I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list . The room had such a strong odor of smoke , it gave me a headache ( and I used to be a smoker ) ! The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive . The hotel is disturbingly huge . Very difficult to navigate your way around it . I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located . She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up . Uhhhhh , how do I know which direction to go in ? ? ? Stains on the carpet in the room . A big gauge in the wall , where maybe a thermostat once was ? ? ? The shower is decent . All in all , for the price they charge , NO THANKS ! ! ! I 'm just glad my company is footing the bill .
My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend . This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location . Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming . The rooms had the best electronics I 've ever seen . Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall . The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by , so we avoided it too . Ate at Joe 's across the street - excellent seafood . And you can shop til you drop without going outside ! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached . Lots of good `` food on the run '' places in there . Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad . I will go back !
My friend and I stayed for just one night , and loved the hotel . It had an awesome water feature in the hotel , and great large bar . Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed , lot 's of pillows , and large bathroom .
Ok , so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location , finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had , I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor , view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had , room is nice , bath was all appliances and good size , good plasma tv , free internet , we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food ! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise , the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel
OK , we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating . I ca n't believe the bad reviews . I got a priceline deal , and I still got a fine room , clean , up-to-date furnishings ( OK a little traditional for my taste ) and smoke free . Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews . I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth . Here it is from my point of view . Both rooms on 10th floor . Regarding the size of the rooms . We had two rooms . One was a 2 double bed room . It was about 20 ' x 15 ' . Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies . The furniture , bathroom tile , shower ( no tub ) , wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years . A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV , coffeemaker , ice bucket , and mini-bar . Three separate levels ( TV , ice/coffee , and minibar ) The other room was called `` Queen executive '' . This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence , sofabed , two TVs and terry bathrobes . Also about the same size but different configerations . One TV faced the bed , other in the three level cabinet , the sofabed . Smoke in the lobby . There is a bar to the right of the entrance . It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door . No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms . Cost of rooms $ 75 on priceline plus taxes . Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint . Concierge said that the free trolley did n't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does . Was this ignorance ? or trying to throw more business to taxi ? Either case , not good . He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter ... .which is clearly incorrect .
As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro , I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left . She seems to have a cough today . In the room on my right , someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit . I hear the water running and the toilet flushing . I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs . Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms . I 've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst . The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains , the curtains with a large brown stain ( I do n't want to guess what it is ) , paint peeling , rips in the wallpaper . The decor is a bit garish , with Pepto-Bismol covered walls , green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet . The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable , but I 'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others ' toilets flushing all night . The location is good for downtown theaters or business . Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly . Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I 've enjoyed quite a bit . Unfortunately this is not one of them , and even more unfortunate for me : I 'm stuck here for two more nights . I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip , comfortable and attractive . This is not .
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews , I was expecting an exceptional stay . I was not impressed overall . The concierge , the view , and the hotel resturant were the highlights . The bed , although not horrible , was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home , and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person . I was traveling for business , and although not dressed in formalwear , was also not dressed down , but all in all , it felt a bit pretentious to me . There are better options for the money , and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place , Sheraton Towers , or Trump for the similar price and better stay . I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings ... ... not # 1 in Chicago , in my book .
Overview : -- Overrated hotel in a premium location . The Great : -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants , bars , and sights . The Good : -- Inviting lobby , pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby , in particular the night deskman . -- Nice bathroom , comfortable bed and desk chair . The Mediocre : -- Room ( excluding bathroom ) was underwhelming in design . -- No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray 's across the street . -- Free cocktails 5-7pm in `` lounge '' is right idea with wrong execution ; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door . -- Hot water ( or lack thereof ) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm . Pressure is pretty low . -- View - mine was n't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible . The Bad : -- Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day , even when my computer was n't moved - really aggravating . Same deal for my iPhone . I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is . -- No blackout curtains ! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning ( not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night ) . Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I 've ever stayed at . -- Noise ! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling , bar music , trucks , car horns , and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning . I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor . -- TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel . And the remote was useless . -- In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting . Do n't even think of opening it ; there 's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost . Summary : -- Not recommended . Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is . Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star .
This morning , I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I 've ever had : Hard Rock Hotel , Chicago . I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the `` Preferred Hotels '' group . Upon checking in , I was `` greeted '' by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show . My room was poorly lit and dirty . The desk/desk chair was covered in sticky , dried soda pop ( or something else ? ) which I had to clean myself so I could work . The `` sound system '' was put to shame by my 10-year-old daughter 's boombox . No one , rock star or otherwise , wants to reach more than an arm 's length for toilet paper . Everything is possible . This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the `` everything is possible '' line . Great marketing fails with no follow through . The in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time . Do you charge Steven Tyler $ 7.81 for opening his in-room 'fridge ? Looking back , I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty , drafty , overpriced bar ( with a horrendous wine list ) With the exception of the fact that I was leaving , check-out was no better than checking in . I was n't even asked about my stay ! The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant . I , for one , will not bring my business back to that location . Next time I 'm in Chicago , I 'm staying at the Hyatt . Rock on , TripStarr
First , several day s prior to my stay , I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday . Saturday they did n't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday . I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night . The food was limp and uninspired . Further , I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . When I called in-room dining to request a spoon , I was told one would be forthcoming . 15 minutes later , a waiter arrived with a menu . When I explained I already had food and I did n't need a menu - I needed a spoon , he had the audacity to argue with me . I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . Another 15 minutes ( and one bowl of cold soup ) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request ( again ) they send someone with a spoon . They too argued with me and expressed that they 'd already sent someone with a spoon . I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I did n't request , but that no spoon was forthcoming . Another 15 minutes later , a spoon finally arrived . Thanks - for charging me $ 100+ so that I could argue over cold , flavorless food . In addition to the gross customer service , surly attitude , and sorry food , I found the room woefully lacking . It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell . Further , I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators ... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went .
This review has two parts . . .I advise reading both . Chapter One : The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating . The room was nice and clean as well . I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff . This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront , or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North . Very easy ( one block ) walk from the subway ( Red line ) . The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial . Not just muffins and coffee . You can have a complete breakfast here if you want . And , even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient . I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location , the room , and the staff . Chapter Two : The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival . The rate was quoted to me as $ 159 per night for four nights . When the confirmation was emailed to me , it was incorrect by over $ 300 . I immediately called the hotel . They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount . I did receive the corrected confirmation email . . .All done ? NO . One week later , my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged . I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve . When I explained the error , I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations , and told `` That 's not my problem . I ca n't help you '' . . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount . Excuse ME ? Now , I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance . After a few left messages , I get the general manager to call me back , and discuss the issue . After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with , he assures me that he will credit the account immediately . I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc . . . One week later , still no credit . So , I call the general manager again . Oh , this might take up to 72 hours to process , I am told . So , please give it another week . Another week passes , still no credit . So another call to the manager . I am told now that the credit HAS been processed , and he even sends me an email confirming our `` agreement '' for the credit , just to appease me . Another week passes . Still , not seeing that credit that was `` definitely processed '' a week ago . Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago . I told him I will be arriving , and at this point , I want to see him personally , and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there . Remember , we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved . I arrive at the hotel , and to make a long story short , the general manager was NEVER available to see me , nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me . The only person I spoke face to face with , was the assistant general manager . He was completely unconcerned with my situation , and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of `` you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said ' '' . . . WHAT ? ? ? ? Today , my trip is over , and I have flown back home . I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT ! ! ! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service , and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point . Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel .
I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a `` pleasure trip '' -- the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent . The room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv . Had breakfast at Zest ( hotel restaurant ) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet . The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park , museums and the aquarium . There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though , considering the sales tax is 9.5 % ! ( and possibly raising to 11 % ) Great stay . I highly recommend it and would stay there again .
We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago . The hotel is fabulous , very chic and chilled . The service is beyond compare . Check in and out were swift and painless . The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay . The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents . We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city . The room ( a deluxe king ) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies , hairdryer , safe , tv , robes & slippers , a very interesting selection of minibar items ( one of which was a real surprise ! ) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area . The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv . The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day 's activities from our bedroom . We were so busy touring around the city we did n't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab . The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more . Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available . The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g . The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they 're away from home on business . Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends . Next visit to Chicago I 'll definitely be staying here and would n't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards .
What 's not to like ? -- > Problems getting the room you actually reserved : I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved . -- > Overcharging . They charge for everything here . Wireless . The Fitness Center . The Business Center . I 've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center . Note to the Intercontinental : If you 're going to charge for something that is commonly included , you should advertise that fact . What 's next ? Charging for sheets on the bed ? -- > Very poor customer service . The staff does not communicate in full sentences , or wait to hear your answer . This is Chicago , not New York . How about a little Midwestern patience ?
The Good - excellent location , neighborhood is pretty and quiet , close to shops , restaurants , the waterfront , close to train/subway station , etc The Bad - Very old decor , which is n't a big deal , but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor . We were supposed to have a king bed ( anniversary trip ) we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened . The shower/tub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower . Who wants to shower in someone else 's dirty water even if it is your wife . The indifferent - room was a decent size , bed linens were okay , staff was mediocre to marginally rude
Got a great deal through Hotwire for $ 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again , even at full price . We really liked the rooms muted modern decor , we had John Lennon and Bono for company . Comfortable bed , mini coffe maker , plenty storage space and a lovely , clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products ( so I was sold straight away ... it does n't take much , I know ! ) . If you 're a product junkie , tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies : ) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave , found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed ( reception , gift shop and bar ) . The bar area is very trendy , I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking ... the lack of memorabilia did n't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway . The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh , and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a `` friendly lady looking for business '' when he was at the bar . I think it 's a place you will either love or hate , if you like laid back , contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you !
My wife & I celebrated our anniversary at the Knickerbocker & could not have been treated better . Before we were out of our cab , our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman . The rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly . This is a prime location for shopping , sightseeing or nightlife .
I wrote an email to the sales & reservation team a week ago ... ... ... i 'm still waiting for a response . All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer . We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails . Shame you missed out , coz we tip like rockerfellers ! !
I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby . While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers . When we arrived it took over an hour to check in . We had requested two rooms on the same floor , which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival . When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it . Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there . We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers . When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in . We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping . We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests . After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate . This `` something '' never arrived . We will not be making a return visit to this hotel . While the housekeeping staff , location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative .
The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges . No - not a bit worn - very much so I 'm sorry to say . Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. ca n't be beat , and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons , there were quite a few bumps in the road . Number one , the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing . The desk chair was so badly worn that the `` lift '' button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we 're not grossly obese . The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable . My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth , one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk . The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink , so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door . The towels were very well worn and thin , although bath sized , which was a plus . The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say , it was horrific . We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables , and they ( appetizers ) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen . A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side , served on a large white plate , and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad . Even the menu , as limited as it was , looked as though someone 's child had written it out . The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go . Unfortunately for us , the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $ 325/nt for our disappointments . The good news is that the mini bars ' wares were incredibly well-priced - when 's the last time you had a $ 4 beer anywhere in a hotel ? ( even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol ! ~ ) The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating . The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful , and the bed comfortable . The A/C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever , and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90 's our entire stay . Free wi-fi - YES ! And it was n't horribly grindingly slow ! No need for the advertised `` upgrade '' for faster wi-fi . Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game . Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased , but we were sadly not .
I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got . The room was pleasantly decorated , functional and very clean . I did n't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt . I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order . It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district .
Great front desk staff , the rest of the experience was dreadful . The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered . We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet , adjacent to our room ( almost in the room itself ) . They do these random room checks for the minibar , as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $ 9 peanuts . The roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones . If you like sleeping in on your vacation , do n't stay here . Also , the hotel was under massive construction , a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website . SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it . No discount because of the work and noise . I 'd rather sleep in a box in the alley .
The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy . The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding , making it dark . They charge a lot for internet hook up , wifi is not included . The staff was very slow , I am assuming they were all new . They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby . The room was set up weird , the bathroom opened facing the bed , rather than the hall as most do . Room temp was hard to control , even though they had a digital thermostat . Overall I was very disappointed , had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels .
I 'll keep it short . My wife , daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel . Location : It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave. ) , so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do . Hotel : The hotel itself is very clean , as were the rooms . Maid service was excellent , including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service ( I think they missed a night ) . Service : Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind . They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile . Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room ( sometimes chocolates on our pillows ) . They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it . There was no shortage of people to ask things . My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get . They shouuld have more than one , or longer hours . Other : We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good , and well attended , appointed . They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet . The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids . It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking . Pool and changing areas were spotless . Room : Clean , sunny and spacious . Probably over 400 sq . ft. - 2 TVs , couch , desk , chairs - all in perfect shape . The windows open for some fresh air . Pillows were pretty comfortable . With all aspects considered , I think this was an unbeatable value ! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend . I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel . It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there . Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number . The airlines have cornered the market on that .
Not a good start when the front desk is n't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! We reserved a King Suite , and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front . Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch , he offered us a free breakfast , but would not up-grade our room . The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni . We will not be retuning to this Hotel again .
a great hotel , we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great , that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel . So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9 $ and we used the buses alot ( freezing cold ) . The hotel itself is great , very clean rooms , realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had . Staff very friendly , they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes ... . and she was right i got them in one place she told me ... thats service ... I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area , did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price ... .but realy a nice view makes running easyer ... .
Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay . Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift , but everything else made up for that . Positives : Bed was very comfortable , great to have real shower , free internet , gym usage , staff ( all friendly ) and location . Negative : Lift noise , lifts slow and restaurant ( there are so many great restaurants around - do n't bother staying in ) Would stay again !
We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline , paid $ 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago . The location is great . The hotel minimally OK > Unsure how it gets a 4* rating . It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift . Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay . However I would NOT recommend this hotel . I would rather have paid $ 100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case . My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GET ... ..NOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE. ! ! IN MY OPINION .
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel . Good location but the room was dirty , and not just from the last housekeeping . It was dingy : a place where you needed the slippers they provided . And this was a suite . Also , the refrigerator was caked with ice and did n't work . Furthermore , because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel , I showed up a day late . The hotel said it was n't a problem and that I would n't be charged for the no-show the night before . I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day . Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve . Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again . Two dots only because it 's in a good location and because the lobby was clean . I 'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad .
I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been `` downgraded '' to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single `` I 'm sorry '' , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me `` I will decrease the rate for you '' `` what do you think , nice eh ? '' like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .
Great place , great room , great location . Even though there was a big meeting going on ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns ) the only consequence for us was slow elevators . Ballroom is amazing , shops on ground floor a nice throwback . Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it . Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . Definitly would return .
We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend . We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m. , and they were able to give us our rooms early . Hooray ! We were on the 5th floor ( Beatles theme ) . The rooms were very comfortable . One of our rooms was on a corner , and had lots of windows . The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . Not a great view from our side of the hotel , but we did n't pay for a room with a view . The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable , the bathroom was full of Aveda products , and there was a bathrobe in the closet . The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice , but we were n't in the room a lot to use it . We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we 'd be charged . No problems there . We did not make use of the free fitness center , because the weather was perfect . My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead . He said it was wonderful . We did use the free internet in our rooms . It was 'wired ' internet , but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . The room was a bit dim at night , but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . There was virtually no hall / elevator noise . The location of the Hard Rock is ideal . It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery , just blocks to either Grant Park , The Art Institute , State Street Shopping , or Michigan Ave. To sum up , there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about . We would be glad to stay here again any time .
I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held . I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location ( an easy walk to the conference ) . From the lobby to the rooms , this hotel lives up to it 's storied reputation . ( The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! ) And even tho ' I was there for a conference , the hotel 's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters , made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price .
