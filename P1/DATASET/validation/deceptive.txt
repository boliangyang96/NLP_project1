My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! The staff were helpful and considerate , always there to tend to my needs . My suite was extremely clean , and had all the amenities that I could ask for . I almost did n't want to leave my room , because it was so nice . But in the end I did , because the hotel is situated in such a great area , that I had to go out and see some of the sites . This hotel has wonderful rooms and service , and is in a really great area . I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago .
The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay , my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time . The rooms were very well organized and comfortable , the staff there are very friendly , and the food there is more then amazing . we are defiantly going back next year .
I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied . I arrived to find that they had `` lost '' my reservation . They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation . After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in . He was almost helpful . He searched the database and found that there was a `` cancellation '' ; however , it was not for the type of room I had reserved . I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days . I was given a box with a bed in it . They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation . Unfortunately , I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked . I had no choice but to accept what they had offered . I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here . Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything , even if it was their error .
Grant it , this hotel seems very nice , but I was not at all pleased with my stay here . The customer service was horrible . I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either . For as much as I paid to stay here , you 'd think the least you 'd get is an iron . Not ! I had to request an iron , too ! In addition to all of the failed amenities , I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and was n't reimbursed until an entire week later . The next time I choose to visit Chicago , Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay .
The Hotel Monaco claims to be a `` boutique Chicago luxury hotel , '' but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish . The pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view , but that was certainly not the case for this customer ! The decor , which might be `` cutesy '' or `` charming '' to some was actually quite tacky and outdated . The bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be `` one of the top 40 hotels U.S. '' Do n't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos -- this hotel does not live up to its billing . You will be disappointed , as was I , if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel .
I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised , as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway , and he usually picks bad places-haha . Anyway , the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . It was busy and the line was a little long , but it moved quickly . The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good , especially since it seemed to be near full . The room was clean and spacious ( especially considering it 's a city hotel ) . We made a lot of use of the concierge , since again , it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans . He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district , and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy . My husband is not as easily impressed , but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . Overall , really nice stay in a four star , or probably four and half star hotel !
When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced . Our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby . And finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor . The room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day , it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side . Our experience was definitely not a pleasant one . To make matters even worse , we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left . I am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel .
For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor ( think Motel 6 at a Hilton price ) . Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin . They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks , so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of . For the prices they charge ( $ 350.average price for two people ) . It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby , which was happening while I stayed , could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms . But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests , which I wo n't be .
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago . My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff . I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy . The bed was so nice and soft ! Even the pillows were fluffy . I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe . The local restaurants were amazing . I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future .
My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things ; shop the Magnificient Mile , see Shedd aquarium , go to the museum of Science and Industry . Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things . It was a luxurious treat of a weekend ! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool . It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite , so we could prepare our own meals some days . The staff was friendly and courteous ( they even gave me an extra pillow on request ! ) and we would definitely stay there again .
I would like to add a comment , maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed . She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding , and Sofitel made this happen for her . They took care of all the invitations , cake decor , and so much more . The special day for my daughter was worth everything . If you are going to be in the Chicago area , check them out ; you will not regret it !
If you are ever going to visit Chicago and need a place to stay I recommend this hotel . This hotel made my stay in Chicago one that I will always remember . The rooms were very big and luxurious , everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service . The room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted . The price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite . If you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel !
The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with . I got the Executive Room with a king size bed . When I got in , the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud . I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me . They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them . The Ipod dock was not working either . Also , the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm . This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there !
Beautiful hotel in chicago . I visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife . They are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services . I would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago .
I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago . It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life . clean , comfortable and pretty . The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring . I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink . The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes . I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area .
The name `` Hard Rock '' might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here . The website alludes to musicians and parties but if you 're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short . The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this . The service is mediocre and the rooms are n't clean . I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun , exciting romance . I should have picked somewhere else . Save your money .
When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . That was just the first of our `` issues '' . The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and I saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . We were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . We ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay -- but I would not recommend this place to anyone !
A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday . The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming . But , We quickly found out that was not the case . Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in . The bathroom was filthy , it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks ! ! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror . There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room . We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly , unkempt room . The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling `` was not smoke '' because that is not permitted in the hotel . We were also told that room was cleaned that day . After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager , we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time . WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us . The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced . Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there . All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests . I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one .
Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . At first once coming into the room , there was a mildewy smell in the air , which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . To make matters even worse , the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon , when my wife was back from exploring the city . This was simply unacceptable by any standard .
My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . What I expected to be a very pleasant experience , turned out to be a stressful visit . We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation . Upon arrival , the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful . As we had no other options , we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds . I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! There was n't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I can not help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out . To add insult to injury , the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation , partial refund or related `` perk '' to make up for our great inconvenience . Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! Although we paid for the breakfast package , we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense . Pardon the pun , but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel 's lack of customer service ! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but , thus far , we have received no satisfaction . Needless to say , we will not be visiting this property again ! In fact , we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels .
I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown , and found it lacking in the quality of their service . The rooms are nice and well furnished , but the service lacks in some areas . Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access , cardio-fitness and indoor pool , grocery shopping service and coffee , tea , hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby 's 24 hour convenience shop . However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times , the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned . The grocery shopping service was alright , although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality . Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 , I would give it a 3 at best .
I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel . The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance . Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level , this was most disappointing . Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff .
I 've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best . Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there . The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly . The room has always been very clean . The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed . Thankfully I do n't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I 've found my favorite .
It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say , i 'd definitely go back , not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed , but most importantly , because of the hotel that we stayed in . The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests , but with pets too . At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog , but I was surprised it turned out the other way . I 've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that 's really frustrating , it 's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly . I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago .
I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three . I absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic . They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay . For the nights we did n't want to go out , we had room service . The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick . I also loved their commitment to the environment . It is clear to me why they have won so many awards . Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay !
My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way . Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant . I went up to my room and looked around , all seemed ok at first . I was bushed so I flopped on the bed ... ohhhhh noooooo ! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days . But I was so tired that I just passed out . Of course I woke up with a back ache ... great . I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub , turned the hot water on full force , and poured in some shower gel . I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm . I called the front desk but they were no help , the clerk just apologized . Frustrated at this point , I turned on the tv and switched on the air . I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent . It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something . I could n't take anymore of this . I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk . It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized , no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac . He offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever .
Hard Rock Hotel is a must to visit . No matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay . Filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining . This Hotel is the place to be . Great views in every location , especially Chicago . The service is incredible along with the food and decor . The Hotel staff will help you feel right at home , no BETTER than home : )
This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago . It is ideal for the corporate executive . Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean . The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience . While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city , which is picturesque especially at night , when the city lights come on . The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area . I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive !
WARNING ! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels . I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends . After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott . They were promoting up to $ 30 breakfast credit per day . And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time . Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee ( which we would n't have known had he not told us ) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group . Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved . If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 , not a luxury hotel in Chicago . The linens were stained , room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee . I was truly disgusted . After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep . The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests . I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten . The toast was stale , eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs , and the juice they served was sour . I would never recommend this as a place to stay . I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime .
I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter . I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels . I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation . Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way . I booked the hotel stay for over a week , which was very expensive , and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL , despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well ! They did nothing to accommodate me , and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she `` did n't know the area '' To tope it all off , the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it . Worst hotel experience of my life , I will never go back . - Sandy D .
From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me . Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly . I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room , which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight , and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago . After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant . Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit .
My husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it . It is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . The staff was very helpful and the room was great . It was definitely worth every penny ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .
I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago . Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 ( one ! ! ) front desk agent 30 minutes to process . Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding , it seemed , wrong room types and being out of the room type requested . I was nervous about my own reservation and , sure enough , my Superior Corner room was n't available . The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available . I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel . Want internet ? Upcharge . Want extra pillows ? Upcharge . Extra coffee for the room ? Upcharge . Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating . I wo n't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking .
I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago . From the outside it looks like a great hotel , and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy , not what I expected when looked at the website . The front desk staff was nice enough at first , but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra . I mean come on , I 'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . ( Note to self , do n't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . ) So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview ( from some of the rooms ) and it seems pretty safe . Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I 've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens , a better restaurant , where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour ( we stayed two nights and we did n't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 ) . I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . In general it seems lke it 's on the decline and the staff knows it , they 're just kind of lackadaisical . I would n't stay there again .
The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable ; it has a very modern feel . The rooms were very well designed , and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means . The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable .
My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic . We got a very reasonable price for our stay ( especially since we were a AAA member ) , and there was plenty of perks to utilize ; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few . Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that , upon request , the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room . How cool is that ! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable . I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area .
when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse ! . i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .
Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud , it is hard to sleep during the night because all the `` city '' noises coming from the outside . The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband , and we supposed to get room with king size bad , but instead we got , two single beds . The stuff is n't really very nice either , they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you .
My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one . I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping . I also loved the Pump Room . What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary . The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost . They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up . I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained . The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me . I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago .
My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant . When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our `` Experience Designer '' who was not the friendliest of people . Also , me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed . For the price , I would have expected a more luxurious experience .
My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer . During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro . I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations , the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous , and the whole process was quick , easy , and painless . Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon , the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease . The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent . Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up .
I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April . I was in town on business , and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine . Having spent a weekend there , I have no idea what my friend was talking about . The complimentary morning coffee was weak ; the fitness room was dimly lit ; and I thought I 'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed `` overnight '' laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on . My room was adequate , but nowhere near what I 've seen elsewhere at this price point . Recent renovation must be slang for `` everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive . '' The mattress in my room was incredibly firm , and I slept poorly . When I travel , I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home . At most hotels , I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations . This was an exception to my usual , and I wo n't be back anytime soon .
We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference . I have to say , normally I am very easy going about amenities , cleanliness , and the like ... however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review . Truly , DO NOT stay at this hotel . When we arrived in our room , it was clear that the carpet had n't been vacuumed . I figuered , `` okay , it 's just the carpet . '' Until I saw the bathroom ! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned ( i.e. , a paper band across the toilet , paper caps on the drinking glasses , etc. , it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place . There was a spot ( probably urine ! ) on the toilet seat and , I kid you not , the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass . I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things `` appear '' clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary . Well , the Hilton was proof . I called downstairs and complained , and they sent up a chambermaid hours later . Frankly , I found the room disgusting . The hotel itself , outside the rooms , was cavernous and unwelcoming , with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din . Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this . When I got home , I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not , such was the skeeviness of our accomodations . Please , do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel .
My husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister 's wedding . The hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests . When we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were , helping us check and get our guests situated . They were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest 's rooms . Our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed , with a view of the city . We held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall . After my sister was married in a church downtown , we held the reception in the large banquet hall . Again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner , the DJ and all of the wedding 's decorations . We had a great time . Ambassador East Hotel is highly recommended !
My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently , and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience . I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro 's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services , so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night . Upon arriving , the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant . Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint , but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy . After check-in , which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing , we headed to our room trying to be optimistic . Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested , the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound , and we only had a stock of 2 towels , which were never replaced during our stay . We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel . It was a huge disappointment , for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl . I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel . There are much better choices in the Chicago area .
The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence . The rooms are beautifully decorated , with class and superior quality furniture . The hotels restaurant `` lockwood '' consist 's of delicious French and Italian cuisine . The location is in the prime area to downtown , and shopping areas . This hotel is suited for pristine guests , and those who are not willing to settle for less . If you 're looking for not just any stay , but a stay in luxury , you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try . It is one of the best of the best in Chicago , and your stay will be one to remember .
When I planned my summer vacation , I was wanting to travel somewhere new . Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life . I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel . It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there . The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues . The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious , I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied . I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town . I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later .
The hotel was very nice ; Service was great , everyone was very friendly . The room was very elegant and classy . The bed was so comfortable . The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system . Not bad . Overall I had a great experience ; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room , I left here well rested and happy .
MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND . IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL . THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT . WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING . ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE . THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS . I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE . ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES . WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN . GREAT HOTEL !
I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel , and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had . One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special , `` pure '' rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic . Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities . I 'll tell you this right now -- save your money . When I got to my room , I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold . To add to the gross factor , I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet . The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it . There was no way I was going to stay in this room , so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room . The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer . After making me wait for another twenty minutes , she finally informed me that they could put me in another room , but it would be a four hour wait . Four hours ! It was absolutely ridiculous . No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way . I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again .
I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance . However , I later learned that I had made a poor choice . Upon arrival , the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk . Although , when we reached out hotel room , we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite . My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds . The clerk , after a twenty minute waiting period , was able to find us a suitable room . Upon entering , the room was noticably hot . We turned on the air conditioning , and after waiting for thirty minutes , the room remained muggy and humid . I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room . They promised a repairman within ten minutes . 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up . They once again promised a speedy repair . While waiting , I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp . I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level , but I had to go get them . After all this trouble , I argued that they should bring it up to me , but in the end , I wound up going to get it myself . After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes , the repair man had not shown up . So I called again , and within 5 minutes the repairman came . He managed to fix the air conditioner , but it was about 12am . We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off , but as the night went on , we noticed another problem . The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds . It also emitted a strange odor . Upon checking with the front desk , we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired . There were not available rooms left , and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service , we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel . I do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time .
The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure . Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable , but the food in the restaurant was exquisite . Not to mention the perfect service from the resort 's employees ! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs . I 'm naturally a fitness freak , so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor . Best of all , it was available to guests at any time , day or night . The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area , so it was n't a far walk to scope out the shops . The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up . It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life . I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave . Any time that I make my way back to Chicago , you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago . I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling .
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while . At almost $ 500 a night , one would expect . Traveling with my wife , I expected to pay the cost of the room , already being outrageous , but then I was hit with another $ 20 charge for her to stay . Even with a King bed , they only figure in one person to their cost . The beds were average and although there was much to do , everything cost an arm or a leg . It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away . All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis , if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night , I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . I guess you live and you learn , its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations .
Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view . The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago . I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this . I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well . The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors . The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed . I give the hotel a 5 out of 5 .
My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown , so he chose the Amalfi Hotel , located conveniently to everything we needed . This place was phenomenal ! ! ! He chose a romantic getaway package , as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever . The hotel is super clean and very chic ; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb . We were able to bring along our dog , which was also really important to us . The first day we were there , we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple 's massage . The masseuses come straight to your room so it 's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great . After our massages , we went to the Keefer Steakhouse , which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic . They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill , which was nice as well . In all , our 3 nights there were pretty similar , we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there ; I 've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City .
My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week ( in a studio suite , which was NOT worth the extra payment ) . It was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! To begin with , the room is listed as 'oversized ' , when it 's nothing of the sort . We 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller . I believe the only extra space was in the closet , which is n't very useful unless you plan on living there ! We had our two sons with us , so we had to make extra sleeping space . Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time , complaining of bugs moving around . He must have been umcomfortable also , as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . The room service is horrible , they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm , and she had to wait up for that . My family would NEVER go back to this hotel , and I highly recommend you also stay well away .
Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently . The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit , but not to the point of garishness . The convenient location was a plus .
My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary . We just love it ! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly . The hotel has very good cuisine options , which are all very tasty ! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there . The rooms are very comfortable and quiet . Perfect for relaxing ! Will definitely keep coming back !
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July . For a `` luxury '' hotel this place did not meet my expectations . For starters , we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room would n't be ready for at least another hour ! I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants , Kitty O'Sheas . Well , we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . Once we finally got to our room it was OK , although not great for the price . We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view , and there were not extra towels as I had requested . We had to call room service twice to receive them , then another two times because our air conditioner was n't working . Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone . Next time I 'm in the Chicago area I wo n't be staying at the Hilton . I 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money .
I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel . Same experience , less money !
My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my son 's wedding . When we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car . After waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip , which I found rude . After finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom . I was extremely disappointed with the room and the service . I will not recommend this place to anyone .
The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit . My wife and I utilized the park & play package , which gave us an amazing room , complimentary valet service , and a great kit to plan our weekend around . It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again . The rooms were top notch and the hotel 's staff was excellent . One of the employees , Craig , helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests . We loved our visit and are sure you will too . A+
I have to admit , I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia , but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago , my fears were slightly assuaged . A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before , and had nothing but positive things to say . With this new-found optimism in mind , I went forward on my journey in confidence . I have to say , I was not let down . From the moment I stepped into the lobby , I felt at home . The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms , and the check-in process was fast and efficient . The rooms themselves are incredibly homey , feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire 's mansion . The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels , really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago , and provided a secure place to stay at night , or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group . Of course , the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel . I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building . Overall it 's very cozy , and has a certain old-world feeling to it , once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times . It was never overwhelmingly crowded , and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly , yet not intrusive . I do n't usually enjoy staying in hotels , but I love the Allegro Chicago !
Last week , I booked a 'Deluxe Suite ' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago . I took the 'Retreat and Relax ' package deal . The wait to check in was intolerably long , because they were letting some people check in with a dog . I 'm allergic to dogs , and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in . They insisted on escorting me to to my room , every time I came in , like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something . I swear , anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks , asking me if I needed anything . You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something . I went to the pool , but it was full of screaming children . When I went to bed , I could hear the television in the next room through my wall . And what 's worse , they would n't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress . They threatened to throw me out on the street , after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! I had to go outside -- probably where the dog went to piddle -- to do it . Also , their on-site restaurant is too expensive , given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room . The food should be free ! I would n't stay here again , it was a waste of my money .
This hotel was gorgeous ! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future . The staff was friendly , the room was clean , comfortable and very well decorated . The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional . The food was delicious and the room service was prompt . This hotel is also in a great location . It is close to everything anyone may need , such as shopping , food and attractions .
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice , but it certainly does not `` exceed expectations '' as touted on their website . Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler . `` Chic but not fussy '' is an overstatement . The room was clean , although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it had n't been cleaned since the last guest . There was hand lotion and shampoo samples , but no soap sample . The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed . `` Cheap '' might have been a better adjective . Check out was simple and not much hassle . Overall , the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch , but next time , I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room .
I would not stay at this hotel again . The rooms had a fowl odor . It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned . The neighborhood was also less than desirable . The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms . I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted .
My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , IL . Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel . My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern . My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms . On Saturday night , my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom . The food was excellent , the hotel chefs were the best . The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner . Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory . It was a fun filled weekend with great food , clean rooms , excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want ! We will definitely be staying here again !
Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint , that is about the only positive of this terible hotel . The guest services were unhelpful at best , and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful . And as for the rooms , small , cramped , and it seemed as if the sheets had n't been cleaned in the last 5 years . My stay here was distasteful , and I never intend to return , except to ask for my money back .
The Homewood Suites by Hilton , in downtown Chicago , has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city . After asking the doorman , I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen . The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take , as did the stove and LCD televisions . This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago . It 's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $ 40 a night , which is what I payed when I stayed there in September . The atmosphere was warm and cozy , and the staff were all very friendly and professional .
Extremely disappointed in our stay . This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online . I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be , only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for . The room smelled musty and not clean . Garbage was not changed from prior person . Found small ants in bathroom near shower . Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray . Overall this hotel is in a great location , but we would never visit again . Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online .
The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy . The room had a great view of a lake . Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . There was a business center that had internet , fax machines , and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day . One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs , it was exactly what I needed , very relaxing . The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate , I never wanted to leave . This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again .
I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again ! The staff was rude , the room was dirty , and the decor is ugly and garish . AVOID at all costs !
I recently made a business trip to Chicago , in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel . During my visit , I had an aroma-harmony massage . This experience greatly relieved my stress , from all the business meetings I 'd had that day . Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles , especially . This was the only amenity that I sought out , during my trip . My time was very limited . However , the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest . I 'll definately stay at this hotel again when I 'm in the area . And , I highly recommend the spa !
I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online . However , my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations . When I arrived , well over an hour of check in time , I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in . The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs , and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd , there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down ( after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue ) . As I am a fairly light sleeper , I woke up several times throughout the night . I would recommend bringing earplugs if you 're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep . Overall the hotel looked very nice , but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room .
My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I ca n't wait to return . I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean , lovely room near the shopping downtown . Affinia fit the bill . The location was perfect , just one block from the magnificent mile . The decor was modern and sleek , and my room was impeccably clean . They even have a pillow menu ! The price was pretty reasonable , too . I 'll definitely be back .
James Chicago ; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised . I did n't want stay in this hotel , but my wife insisted . Ok , so when I booked the ticket , it cost me $ 299 for one room . $ 299 ! I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point ! The room was stylish though , it looked nice . There was a TV , and the beds were fine . Although I could n't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer . Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer ? What were they thinking ! ? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected . I mean the food available there was n't very tasty at all . I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet , but they had no computer , only wifi . That 's like only having bread , without any fillings to make it into a sandwich !
My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple 's getaway from our usual life , and an escape it truly provided . There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time , let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user ! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us , because things like alarm clocks , hairdryers and ironing boards were already there , electronic media even available for rent . With a comfortable bed , control over how the room felt , no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call , we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity . Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning , but the Hilton was a true vacation . Thank you .
The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago 's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel . After staying there and experiencing the service , environment , and the hotel in general , I can say with confidence that this just is n't true . I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed . No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself . The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me , leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags . Once inside , the atmosphere was not what I expected . The lighting was poor , leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building . The carpet looked dirty , as if it had n't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time , and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage . When I arrived at the front desk , I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me . After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed . The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water . That night I ordered room service . The food took 45 minutes to get to my room , and when it finally arrived it was cold . The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them . I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends , and probably not to my enemies either . Stay away !
The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay . When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in . We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their `` private '' counter that their website highlights . It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in . Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever , but our reservations were completely wrong . I ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room . Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel . I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze . I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area . The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort . Do n't waist your time staying here .
We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids . We reserved the `` Family Adventurer with Paul Frank '' . It 's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium . We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes , which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children 's Museum . My kids had a ball . We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored . All in all , a great weekend where my kids were the focus . The adults certainly were n't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning .
My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago , when my husband went for a trade fair . We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money . Clean and comfortable , chic and new fixtures . The view of the pier was magnificent . Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow . It 's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty .
I just spent the weekend here with my wife , and she loved it as much as I do . I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients , so I did n't have any choice . But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago , I knew this was the place to take her . The hotel has n't just been remodeled , it 's been completely redesigned . Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better , and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces . They are amazing . This hotel is part of a luxury chain , and it 's easy to see why . They offer full room service at convenient hours . I 've been in every eating area now , and they are all great , too . Whether for business or pleasure , you ca n't beat this . It 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect . My wife was stunned , and yours will be , too .
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago , and had a great stay . The rooms were beautiful , the beds comfortable , and the views of the city were fantastic . My room overlooked the river and the city . I felt like I was on a luxury vacation . The hotel has a few different restaurants . I ate at the Chicago Burger Company , which was delicious . The burgers were juicy , and the prices were great . The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities . Overall , I had a wonderful stay .
Fantastic stay ! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference . Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm . Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door . They are the best I 've ever had . EVER ! If youre in the mood to unwind , you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . I had a great time here . From now on , I wo n't stay anyplace else .
I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton , but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment . It started with check in ; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed , but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms ( OK , rather rudely ! ) that because of some banker 's convention that was going on , I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left . It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! The room itself was OK , nothing special though . The cleaning staff must 've just been through , because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air . The internet jack was n't working . It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it , no apologies given . For the price , I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton . I guess they 're really no better than anyone else these days !
We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed . The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests , including individual pillow choices , complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit , and fine dining in two on-site restaurants , one of them roof-top with amazing city views . I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .
I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay . When I first got there , getting checked in was very fast . The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken . The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast . The room was very hip and cool . There was musical items all over the place . I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom . After being in the room a few minutes , I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room . They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room . I needed some things shipped while I was there , which they had supplies to help me with that . After getting some work done , I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around . They gave me information for 3 awesome places . I left and came back after having a night out on the town . They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it . I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift . When I got back to my room , the bed was so comfortable . I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep . In the morning I order breakfast , which was really a Philly cheese steak . They will make anything you want anytime of day . I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed . Thank You Hard Rock , You Rock !
I was very disappointed with this hotel . The front desk clerk was rude ; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins . to get off the phone . When I arrived in the room the bed was n't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty . I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment ( on the twelveth floor ) . Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong . When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean ... There was hair all over the floor , toilet and shower . The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror . My allergies started to bother me , immediately upon entering the room , so I checked the filter in the air conditioner . Which looked like it had never been cleaned.The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum . While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner . Which proved to be as bad as the rooms . The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy . The steak was rare and I asked for medium . Not to mention , it tasted like rotten meat.The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry . To top the whole experience off ... When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay .
This hotel is beautiful , it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it . The location is wonderful , it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier , which was a great place to show the children on our vacation . We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car , and the valet was very nice and helpful . I also take my work with me everywhere I go , So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus . They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing . This place is great for the price , due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is . This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay .
The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding , dong , ditch . The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay . The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap , but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room .
My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago . The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St , in the well-known River North District . We got what the hotel promised : gentle staff , a luxury room with a breathtaking view , magnificent meals and a select wine . I also used its well-equipped gymnasium . We paid $ 586 with taxes for two nights . I think it was a good price , taking in account the excellent conditions we got there . I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago .
Last month , my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS . Although they were very busy , the service was excellent and very professional . The staff were always smiling and happy to help . InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue , and the best stores and restaurants in town . The view from our room was great ! Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night , it was decorated nicely , and the beds were extremely comfortable ! We ate at the hotel 's restaurant Zest , and the food was great ! It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while . We will definitely be back !
My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory . I would have expected much for from such a `` high end '' hotel . The rooms were way over priced , and the service was less than satisfactory . At one point , I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up , and when room service came through , they were still there ! On the other side of things , the cup I had left on my desk ( which I was planning to use later ) was gone . My coffee and my towels were also never replaced . I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room . Rather , it was a `` nominal fee '' . After paying so much for a room , I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi . My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for . I will not be staying there again .
The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me . I chose it because it a Hilton hotel , but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name . My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff . My room might have been luxurious years ago , but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening . The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible . The food served by the room service and at the hotel 's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus , and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine . The food simply did not deliver its promises . Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small . The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage , since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions : however , the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by . Overall , this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range .
We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago . It was elegant , classy , and the service was impeccable . It was very family friendly for us , with the spacious rooms , the kid 's room , and the no smoking policy . We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see . The food was delicious and we did n't have to go outside the hotel to find good food . When visiting Chicago again , we will come back . It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price .

I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels . I got ta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to . In fact , Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet . I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape . In fact , the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early . I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel . I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room , they ignored me . How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo . It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw . I 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter . This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer .
Having traveled to Chicago on business once before , I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip . After some research , I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay . And , in a way , it was perfect -- perfectly awful . After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel 's website , I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary . However , my standard guest room , which the hotel 's website describes as `` deluxe , '' was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels , not pricier historic hotels , such as this one . The carpeting looked dingy , so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window . In addition , the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long . Everything cost extra , including the gym , the pool and the spa , and the restaurant prices were outrageous . This hotel is overpriced , overrated and definitely subpar . I would n't recommend it to my worst enemy .
Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip . The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is , and how clean the rooms are ( even compared to other luxury hotels ) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink , i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed , i 've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones , once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent , bed was soft and the TV did n't appear burned out at all . Overall i give this a five out of five , the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect , i wish i could have stayed longer .
The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby . In other words , come here for the looks , not the amenities . They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process ... . you know , because a simple washing machine just is n't good enough . To me , this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being `` rich '' -- which most of them are not . Meanwhile , the hotel does n't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me . Obviously I 'm not the intended consumer , though , so I guess I should n't be surprised .
This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at . From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food , Amalfi really exceeds its standards . The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible . I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars .
Wow ! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier , Lake Michigan , and all the fabulous dining . The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional , but cozy manner . The entire family loved it , even the dog ... because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel ! We loved the restaurant there , the Pump Room was great , something to please even the pickiest of our eaters . We were there on a family get-away , but asked to see a larger `` suite '' . The suites were gorgeous . I ca n't wait to tell our friends about this place ! Our next business trip to Chicago , we are booking at this hotel . They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service ! We are definitely coming back !
My family and I were in Chicago for a friend 's wedding . We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice , but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel . The hotel appeared very nice , and to have all the amenities : Room service , WiFi , clean rooms . Unfortunately , as it turned out , appearances can be deceiving . It begins at the desk , where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring . He said they did n't have any rooms available because we did n't make arrangements . It was getting late , and we had no place to go , there were n't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving . I asked if there was anything he could do , and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy . I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing , the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night . Apparently , our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard , because this room was n't even clean and the wifi did n't work . We ordered room service , and it never came , even after several complaints . It does n't end there either ; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service . Overall , this was a very frustrating experience , and I would n't stay there again .
From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel , I was very much impressed ! ! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant . The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite . Our suite was beyond belief . The atmosphere was very classy and romantic . My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived . We had traveled to Chicago , from New York , for a romantic weekend get away . We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant , The Pump House , and were very pleased . Dinner started with soup and a salad , main course meal and dessert , all for a reasonable price . We did a little local shopping the next day , after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds . Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience . We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago , Illinois . 5 stars ... .
As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly . They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly . I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom . Also , I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient . Overall , I was very happy with my stay at this hotel .
When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago , I immediately went to their website to check them out . What I found there was decent , nothing really stood out . It was n't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened . The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional . Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly . The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day . When I asked about more towels , the maids were happy to help me out . If I were ever to be in that area again , I know exactly where I 'm staying , the Swissotel .
The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb . the room service was exemplary and the food , I do n't even know were to start . The chef obviously knew what he was doing , I especially loved the seafood , my personal favorite was the shrimp . Aside from this , I loved how beautiful the hotel was . It is definetly a bargain for the price , for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but , I felt as if i was in a $ 10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe . great bang for your buck . Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city . My friends actually went their a while back because of me . They loved it ! I know you will too .
The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic . The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city . The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful . I ca n't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there .
My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago . I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station . I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago 's premiere shopping areas . The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations , while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service . The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world . Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious . In short , Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation , meeting all my needs and more !
Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time . Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight . It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area , it is also close to the Loop , Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space . Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV . The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast . The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.The hotel has a no-smoking policy . It also has free internet facilities , room service , Air conditioning , laundry/drycleaning , multilingual staff to make communication easy , spa services , heating , conference facilities , satelite tv , brailed elevators and pets are allowed . The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great . The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty . The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand . The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean . The hotel makes it possible for you to relax , go shopping in the best stores which are close-by , eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership . They offer great deals for every type of customer . I would definitely recommend this place .
I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops . I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs . I sure was not disappointed by my decision ! This hotel lots of historic charm . Despite being a larger hotel , the service was top shelf ! The rooms , while not large by any means , were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable . My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered . As for me , I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile . The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site . The food was very good and , just like the hotel itself , the restaurant provided perfect customer service . Dollar for dollar , the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again .
This hotel was worth every cent . You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here . In town for a conference , my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything . Fine dining , entertainment , you name it : Knickerbocker 's got it ! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family .
I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago , Il . From the start , the experience was bad . The room was filthy , there were no towels , and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation . I will never stay there again . I could not have been more dissatisfied .
For our anniversary this year , my wife and I stayed at the Conrad . We 're from the suburbs , so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us . It 's expensive , so we expect the best for our money . This was most definitely not the best for our money . It was n't even a good deal either . The problems began right off the bat . When we got to our room , we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room . It was like walking into a dusty attic . When I sat down to watch TV , it turns out it was n't even connected to cable or anything . I kept changing the channel , but it was nothing but static and white noise . I even looked for another remote . After we left our things , we went out for a night in Chicago , but coming back , the smell seemed to have gotten worse . I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms . They moved us to a different room , but they had no explanation for the smell . For a single stay , that was more trouble than it was worth .
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago , IL , and boy was I surprised . The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious . In fact , the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating . As if this were not enough , the bathroom of my room looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the `` fresh '' towels . Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls .
Fantastic Hotel ! Upscale and luxurious , and in a great location ! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty ! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean , the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for ! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities . I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone , and ca n't wait to get back there myself !
I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . When we arrived at the hotel , the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system ( I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it ) . After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked . We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically . I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money . I for one wo n't be going back to this hotel !
This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere . It smells because pets are allowed . This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed . There was mold in our room and bathroom , pet hair everywhere ! Kids love pools . How can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? My kid was bored . The food was basically the same every day , no variation in the menu . Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their `` travel club '' because our room did n't even remotely resemble the pictures . They did the old bait and switch . We reserved a `` family room '' . When we opened the door of our room , we realized that it was n't what the website pictured or had what the website described . We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers . Definitely do not recommend this hotel ! ! !
My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city . We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices . I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton . The staff treated us well , the rooms were clean and roomy ( we loved the Serenity beds ) , and the hotel itself is stunning . It was like stepping back in time . We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions . The weather was lovely , so it was great to walk to Navy Pier , Sears Tower , and the Adler Planetarium . We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago .
My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton . We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . The floors looked like they have n't been cleaned in a while in the check in area . The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . The staff was horrible . We had asked for a turn down service it was never received . I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton .
I went to stay at this hotel last year . I have got to say it was a great authentic experience , the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff . Its location could n't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping . Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful . It is very affordable . I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town .
Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you 're traveling with luggage and/or kids . They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees . Rooms feature either double or king sized beds ; no queen beds at all . If you want a little extra leg room in your bed , the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff . Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge , too .
Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago , i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building . The old fashioned furnishings , the wonderful view , and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel . At first i had been skeptical , but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone . As i entered my room , the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me . During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool , winding down every night with a comforting massage . I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance , but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities .
The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city . For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night , you would think they would have a competent parking attendant . I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room , and if that was not enough . To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork . Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account . I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations .
The location of this hotel was superb ! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same .
Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features . We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco . We decided to stay for 3 nights . When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights . The staff was upstiff , and did n't not offer much hospitality . Our room did have a view , but of the city lights and kept our room bright , even with the curtains closed . The beds appeared soft , but did not offer much comfort . For what we paid , we expected more .
I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton . My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested . I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up . I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there .
The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel , particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv 's . The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room , before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows , which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom . An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay . There 's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince . However , the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use , as well as the whirlpool , Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool . Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks . A nice aspect that is n't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel . The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation , particularly when you do n't want to be separated from your pet , within the area .
